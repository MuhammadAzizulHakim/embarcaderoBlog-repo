# Crawl google scholar using GUI created by Python4Delphi.

The original code is credited to @geekan (https://github.com/geekan/), and all the contributors of https://github.com/geekan/scrapy-examples. I modified the code to update some obsolete Python lines, and to make it suitable to run inside of Python4Delphi GUI instead of regular command-line operations.
