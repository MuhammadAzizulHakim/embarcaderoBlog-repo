"The Alien"

Look beyond the Earth, heading set for the stars
Interplanetary, some are near, some are far
Terraform a new world, survival for mankind
Options but a few, we are running out of time

Should you climb aboard
A voyage, the first of its kind
Ready to explore
All that you've known left behind

Our Holy Grail
Now redefined
Our purpose, a thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand
Life beyond here, digital man

Alien, changed forever
New found world in the stars

Understand the meaning
Certain we'll extend the scale of consciousness
Woman, child and man
Multi planet species out amongst the stars
Not stuck in and around who and what we are

Time to climb aboard
Countdown to takeoff on time
Systems are online (5, 4, 3, 2)
Farewell to all humankind (1)

Our Holy Grail
Clearly defined
Our purpose, a thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand
Life beyond here
Digital man

Alien, changed forever
New found world, here we are

Our Holy Grail
Clearly defined
Our purpose a thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand

Our Holy Grail
Read between the lines
One purpose, one thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand

I am the alien
Out here in the stars
We'll search 'til we find
No matter how far
A far better world
For all human race
And beyond

"Answering the Call"

White walls, glisten
Empires, crimson
Aching within
Raging fire

Sovereign, asphyxiate
No conscience
A solemn state
Misguide, indoctrinate
Accepted long held views

When will there be a day when all of us
Trust in love and peace?
Burns bright for us
When will the long-held truth be cast aside?
Embrace our fellow man, no longer vilified

Radiant we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Illuminating all
Answering the call

Decisions by which to act
Programmed, no turning back
Call upon a switch turned on
An ultimate price to pay

Weeping mother too late to cry
Hold the truth, can't ignore the lie
Time to look it in the eye

When will there be a day when all of us
Trust and know in love and peace
When will the long held truth be cast aside
Embrace our fellow man, no longer vilified

Radiant we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Illuminating all
Answering the call

Fight or flight, both threatening
Hidden thoughts are deafening
Your guilt feeding the flame
Tearful knowing it's a lie
Desired might just past you by
Rituals your funeral pyre

Scars you can't erase
If you choose to face
There is beauty in us all
Walk the higher ground
There you will be found
The writing's on the wall
Will you wager your life?

Radiant we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Walk the higher ground
There you will be found
Illuminating all
Answering the call
Answering the call

"Invisible Monster"

When you face the creature
That waits beneath your bed
Will you stare into its eyes or look away?

Running toward the fire
Or fleeing from the flame
The choice to seek or hide is yours to make

The serpent inside
Wrapping its tail around my neck
I'm buried alive
Dying to take another breath

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave
Invisible monster

Hiding, never showing its face
Feeding on irrational fear
Thoughts race at a feverish pace
Soaring on a flight of ideas

Perched on its victim's shoulder
Whispering in its ear
Things that may never happen
Worries too much to bear

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave
Invisible monster

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave

Invisible monster
Beast that dwells inside my mind
Give up your hold let me take back control
Invisible monster
Invisible monster

"Sleeping Giant"

Some will be driven by conflict
Others will fight the good fight
Some will rely on the darkness
Some will rely on the light
Some elevate with compassion
Yearning for knowledge and peace
Some motivate through aggression
Selfishly serve their own needs

Shadows disappear at night
Buried out of fear
Driven underground
Hidden lies the rage inside
Like a ticking bomb
That doesn't make a sound

People will obsess
With suffering and death
Questioning their own desires
This morbid fascination
Renders us possessed
By our violent and destructive side

When we lay our armor down
Fragments of our love
Slip through the cracks of hate
But the raging storm below
Will never go away
If it is not embraced

Shadows disappear at night
Buried out of fear
Driven underground
Hidden lies the rage inside
Like a ticking bomb
That doesn't make a sound

Shadows disappear at night
Harmless as a dove
Clever like a snake
Hidden lies the rage inside
Like sleeping giant
One we dare not wake

Standing under the eclipse
Are we sheltered and concealed
Or bathing in its glow?

Our desires and ambitions
And our need to believe
There is good in this world
Spin a common thread

<|endoftext|>

"Transcending Time"

Drifting in a far off place
I roam the countryside
Seeking wings of thought
Waiting in the blind

Enchanted and transfixed
I am pulled into the still
By a backward ticking clock
Held against my will

Illusions turn to dust
Scatter to the wind
Like dreaming while awake

Signals in the mist
Altered state of mind
Stars in the abyss
Transcending time

Midnight in the garden
Digging for a spark
Where seeds of inspiration
Lie buried in the dark

Attention starts to wonder
As the poet lifts his pen
And the critic from within
Is silenced once again

Limits leave no trace
Ashes in the rain
Lost and far away

Signals in the mist
Altered state of mind
Stars in the abyss
Transcending time

Signals in the mist
Stars in the abyss

Euphoric obsession
Without conscious intention
Being pulled by the current
On a vessel steered by someone else

Transcending time
Transcending time
Transcending time
Transcending time

"Awaken the Master"

Finding your way
On a frozen path where the air is thin
The angel of balance
Keeps you alive

A flower unfolds
A heartbeat brings new meaning to the universe
The angel of balance
Keeps you strong
Discovering what has been all along

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light
Remember hereafter

You made it to the top
Just to find out
You're only halfway there
All along missing the point of the journey

The will of the soul
Like a peak so high
You look inside to rise
Searching out a dream
Climbing, reaching further
And the voices of the angels bring you closer

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light
Remember hereafter

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light

Spinning through
We balance the heart and the mind

Turning the stone
Embracing the truth that we find

Remember hereafter
The end of a chapter
Awaken the master
Awaken the master

"A View from the Top of the World"

[I. The Crowning Glory]

The fire that burns within us
To carry out a dream
Chasing new ambitions
Determined to succeed
To stretch beyond our limits
To blaze a brand new trail
Bold enough to conquer
Brave enough to fail

Sheer determination
Taking nerves of steel
Always digging deeper
Danger all too real

To rise above the challenge
To push to the extreme
To the daring, there can be no in between

See a view from the top of the world
Take a ride on the crest of a wave
The adrenaline rush over and over again
See a view from the top of the world

All my natural instincts
Are begging me to stop
But somehow I carry on
Heading for the top
A physical absurdity
A tremendous mental game
Helping me understand
Exactly who I am

To face a new adventure
To conquer the insane
Lured into madness
Addicted to the pain
Reaching for the summit
On the threshold of defeat
Rightfully joining
The ranks of the elite

See a view from the top of the world
Feel the wind on the edge of the sky
Take a chance you may die, over and over again
See a view from the top of the world

[II. Rapture of the Deep]

I begin the blind ascent
To a place no one has seen
Returning to the womb
On the fringe of the unknown
A journey into darkness beckons me

Like a blind man in a maze
Who somehow finds an open door
The beauty and the danger
And the yearning to explore
Always keeps me coming back for more

[III. The Driving Force]

The moment that you recognize
Just where your limits lie
Hanging on the brink of death
You're never more alive
When you reach the pinnacle
The world is at your feet
Welcome to the mind unleashed
The impossible is never out of reach
When barriers are broken, greatness is achieved
Self belief will build a life of legacy

<|endoftext|>

"Untethered Angel"

You've built this world around you
Your universe
In spite of best intentions
Things could not be worse
Chaos and fear have left you
Hanging by a thread
As you argue with the voice inside your head

Untethered angel
Falling to darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself will set you free

Misgiving and dismay
Nightmares and wasted days
Can't live your life this way
Something needs to change
Cold feet and second thoughts
Entangled, tied in knots
Avoidance at all costs
A painful thing to watch

Fear can live inside you
Push you to the edge
Face the fear within you
Wake up from the dead

Untethered angel
Falling to darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself will set you free
Set you free

Untethered angel
Falling to darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Open your heart
Be set free

<|endoftext|>

"Paralyzed"

The anger, the pressure
You're choking down your words again
Feel the nerves set in
Unspoken frustration
They see right through you
Paper thin
Like the ghost within

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed

The stare of a stranger
Is like a wound that bleeds again
Silent as the dead
The victim
The martyr
Like Daniel in the Lion's Den
Time and time again

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Relentless mental drain
What do you stand to gain?

Viewing life through such a narrow fractured lens
Will ensure you end up on the losing end

Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed

"Fall Into The Light"

Written on the water
Memories dissipate
Eyes begin to open
Darkness drifts away

Time and space like roses
Whose petals drop and fade
And fall into the light
As if dreams of yesterday

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see

There is nothing sacred
Only heaven knows
So turn towards the sun
And look into your soul

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see
Too much hope will never be enough
It's become so clear to me

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see
Too much hope will never be enough
The truth is clear to me

"Barstool Warrior"

In a dark and lonely corner
Of a time-worn dockside inn
Sits a local barstool warrior
Talking to his gin
Tracing past decisions

He motions for a shot
Is he doomed to be a man this world forgot?
Just a prisoner of the monster on his back

Call it bad luck
Call it fate
Call it stuck here the rest of my days
Serves me right
What went wrong?
And where do I belong?

In the glow of flashing lights
On the shoulder of the road
Clutching at the bruises on her skin
She tries to signal danger
With anguish in her eyes
Will he see the world of pain she’s in
Or is it too late?

Was it bad luck?
Was it fate?
Or a past that she couldn't escape?
It's not right
Something's wrong
Just where do I belong?

Promises made
Crying in vain
All empty
Never accepting the blame
And not letting go of the shame
A river of tears
As months turn to years
All wasted
On someone not willing to change
Now only a shadow remains
No one can save you

And there's no one to save
It has been written
You will become all you think,
All you feel, all you dream

Now I'm cutting the anchor away
And I won't look back
I'm starting a new life today
Now I see where I belong

"Room 137"

Someone
Someone is trying
To tell him something
Will he listen?
Should he listen?

Someone
Someone is dying
To find out something
Will he reason?
What is the reason?

Do you see it, there on the door?
Death is coming
Life nevermore
Obsession drives me
Clouding my mind
What's the message?
Am I running out of time?

Someone
Someone is trying
In search of something
Death by numbers
Getting closer

Someone
Someone is dying
To know the answer
The key to heaven
137

Do you see it there on the door?
Death is coming
Life nevermore
Obsession drives me
Clouding my mind
What's the message?
Am I running out of time?

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line
Hidden by design

I can see it here on the door
One-three-seven forevermore
Between dimensions
The boundary line
One-three-seven
I am running out of time

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line
Let me see before I die

"S2N"

Are we paying attention?
Or are we drifting?
Too much negative action
Not enough positive reaction

What's the state of humanity?
Where's the peace and the harmony?
Free the signal, your inner voice
Time to transcend block out the noise

Signal to noise
Becomes the answer
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel

Have you heard the news?
A surging sea of circumstance
Pain, starvation, war, abuse
Sterile gloves hide dirty hands

Shocking truth
Climate change
Floods and fires
Hurricanes
Overdose
Suicide
Innocent die
Fear and race
Endless lies
Sex and faith
Terrorize
Drugs and guns
Taking lives
Innocent die

Signal to noise
Becomes the answer
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel
Signal to noise
Defines the reason
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel
Our wounds begin to heal

Signal to noise
Becomes the answer
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel

As we latch on to the wheel

The chatter disappears
And the message is revealed

"At Wit's End"

Let me help you
How much longer until you realize?
You're getting worse
It's killing you inside
I can't break through
Feel you have to face this on your own
Want to be left alone

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Come alive

You feel I'm asking too much of you
But can't let go
Fear breeds the hate and your apathy
Empty and hollow
You lost your faith
There's no getting through
Why shut me out?
Frantic, disturbed, filled with misery
Can't figure it out

Sleepless, worse for wear
Staring at the ceiling
Numb
Sedated
Intoxicated

Deafening, deafening
Shut it out, shut it out
Burning, burning
No way out, no way out

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Come alive

Asked me to listen
Can't go on and face another day
I lied, not admitting
What I lost is still in you
Something's missing
You see darkness in my eyes
Maculate

There is no cure
Playing over, stop pretending
Warped inside its never-ending tide

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now

"Out Of Reach"

There's something about this girl
Some kind of magic
Swear she cast a spell on me

Not the first time
Might be the last
Can't let this moment slip away
Try to find the words
None sit right with me
Air of confidence
But I can barely breathe

She's without a care
Electrified and held there
A thousand volts igniting me
Her waves crash over me
Far below, out of reach
The undertow, my reverie

Sadness in her smile
Love, it's been a while
Near but far away
She chases it each day
A promise to come back
All the while still waiting
Seems it lost its way

Out of reach
Just too hard to reach
You're letting your life slip away
Out of reach
Yeah it's hard to reach
There's another day
Although you're hurting and afraid
You're stronger than yesterday

<|endoftext|>

"Pale Blue Dot"

So far away from home
Beyond a distant reach
Faint whispers from the edge
Returning piece by piece
A lonely point of light
Captured in a final glance
A solitary hint of life
Discovered if by chance

God creators
Dream destroyers
Spineless cowards and fearless warriors
Hopeful children
Mothers and fathers
Our blood-filled rivers fueled by hate
We worship heroes, kings and saints
But who's out there to save us from ourselves?

All you will ever know
All life that ever was
All you despise or love
Living out their lives
This isolated speck
Hurtling through the cosmic dark
Would seem to go astray
If we were washed away

God creators
Dream destroyers
Knowledge seekers and bold explorers
Hopeful children, mothers and fathers

All on this place we call our home
Adrift in space we're on our own
But who's out there
To save us from ourselves?

"Viper King"

Venomous
By design
Lying idle
Biding time

Bore down the clutch
Tore up the road
Six hundred horses
Genetic code

Lightning speed
The road she bends
Slam down the brakes
Losing my ass end

Drive on
Pushed to the limit
My viper king
We're flying high

Drive on
Filled with desire
Nothing to fear
I feel alive

My viper king

Speed demon
Tempting fate
Do or die
In the blink of an eye

Drive on
Pushed to the limit
My viper king
We're flying high

Drive on
Filled with desire
Nothing to fear
I feel alive

Pushed to the limit

"The Gift Of Music"

[EXT. Ravenskill Town Square - Day]

[Narrator:]
Far in the distant future
Beyond the pages of our time
Cold-blooded wicked tyrants
Threaten the freedom of mankind

Corruption, lust and greed
Define the new nobility
Changing the course of history

Across the vast North Empire
Most people struggle to survive
Living a meek existence
While their secluded leader thrives

[Arhys:]
We are living day to day
Forced to bear the lion's share
People just don't have the time for music anymore
And no one seems to care

My friends I've seen the chosen one
Our quest for freedom has begun
He will be the answer to our prayers

There walks a god among us
Who's seen the writing on the wall
He is the revolution
He'll be the one to save us all

My brother Gabriel is all the hope we need
Shining like a beacon in the night
Shepherd of Ravenskill
A reason to believe

Music is the gift he brings
The songbird stops to listen when he sings

"The Answer"

[EXT. Ravenskill Park - Day]

[Gabriel:]
I don't pretend to have the answer
Never said I held the key
But somehow they see a light inside of me
Am I not the man who I was meant to be?

As the people gather round me
I never felt so all alone
Is this the chance to be someone?
My moment in the sun
Why am I afraid of facing the unknown?

They are finding faith in me and they believe I'm the one to set them free

"A Better Life"

[INT. Ravenskill Rebel Command - Night]

[Arhys:]
As fearless leader of the Ravenskill militia
The blood of warriors
Flows throughout my veins

My brother's gift remains my secret ammunition
It is our hope, our pride
A catalyst for change

Still the fires of revolution burn within my eyes
On this perilous road to freedom
He's our one and only guide

For many years I've seen our people starve and suffer
How many more will die
Before we stand and fight

They ask me Arhys,
"Could things be any tougher?"
The answer's no surprise,
"Yes, you bet your life!"

Now the fires of revolution won't burn for evermore
I see liberty in our future
And it's one worth fighting for

We all long for a better life
Like a dream that can't be denied

This is the moment
Now is the time
Freedom if we live or if we die

I shall give him a better life
I swore this vow to my dying wife
Sure she would not survive

Peacefully
She slipped away
The meaning in my life
Was born that day

And so I found the strength to carry on
With this crusade
It is my fate

Evangeline
You lived a life of misery and pain
Evangeline
I'll never let your memory die in vain

Evangeline
My heavy heart still bleeds
I dedicate my life to set him free
And I will carry on to plant the seeds
I promise in the name of our new son
This battle won't be over until it's won

"Lord Nafaryus"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Narrator:]
How the rumors are spreading like vines
Of a man who has been glorified
News finds its way
To the empire one day
Where the envious ruler resides

[Nafaryus:]
Should I fall for the stories I hear?
Is he really a threat I should fear?
Such a foolish young man
Doesn't seem to understand
So let me be perfectly clear

He may have them inspired
Eating out of his hand
But he'll never be ruler of this land

For myself I must see
What the hype is about
I admit I'm intrigued

I've heard the whispering of revolution
I know the aim of your plan
You think insurgency is your solution
And put your faith in one man

[Narrator:]
His decision is made
So his journey begins
Off to the edge of The Realm
To meet the savior

In the coming days
They'll announce his grace
And he'll ask to be amazed

As a symbol of power and might
It will make for a breathtaking sight
In a massive display
With his family and guards by his side

[Nafaryus:]
Arabelle who means the world to me
Our loyal son, my heir, your future king
And Faythe I treasure more than all the diamonds in my crown
It isn't hard to see
I couldn't be more proud

Into the far off reaches of the land
To witness this great spectacle first hand
Is Gabriel the God he claims to be?
I guess we'll see
Yes we shall see

"A Savior In The Square"

[EXT. Ravenskill Town Square - Day]

[Nafaryus:]

We have come to hear him sing
To see this gift your savior brings

[Narrator:]

A crowd has grown
And all are mesmerized
But silence quickly falls
As Lord Nafaryus arrives

[Nafaryus:]

Please don't stop on my account
Show us what we've heard so much about

[Arhys:]

In peace
We gather here today

[Daryus:]

Don't make him ask again
Do as my father says

[Gabriel:]

Brother, worry not today
I will share my music
And they will soon be on their way
They only know the noise machines
So I'll treat them all to sonic ecstasy

Never in my dreams could I deserve
To ever see a vision quite like her
Then unexpectedly
I'm taken by surprise
An angel just appeared before my eyes

And you're looking toward the light
All that really matters
Is what you leave behind

So let your heart be free
Keep your spirit burning bright
Set down the stones you carry
Take the weight off your mind

When you're facing the path that divides
Know that I will be there by your side
Find your strength in the sound of my voice
And you'll know
Which choice is right

In this fleeting life
We can sometimes lose our way
But night is always darkest
Just before the new day

When you're facing the path that divides
Know that I will be there by your side
Find your strength in the sound of my voice
And you'll know which choice is right

[Faythe:]

This very moment
Was always meant to be
I never noticed
But all at once I see

On the worst of days when I felt most alone
With no one to share the secret that I hide
I grew numb to all the emptiness inside
But now I've found my home

"Act Of Faythe"

[EXT. Ravenskill Town Square - Day]

[Faythe:]

I never knew they spent their days in rags
While I enjoy the life they'll never have
Yet deep within their eyes
Hope still survives
And they don't seem to think this world's so bad

Even as they gather in the square
They know a better life exists out there
With unity and pride
Faith stays alive
How can I pretend that I don't care?

I have always felt alone
Living like a stranger inside of my own home
Maybe now's the time to greet the wings of change
Could my destiny
Be right in front of me?

As a child behind the palace walls
Often times I'd search its secret halls
And hoping I would find
A treasure cast aside
I came upon the greatest gift of all

My music player
My private paradise
My music player
A refuge I must hide

Been lost at sea forever
Adrift and far away
Now finally for the first time
I know I found my way

"Three Days"

[EXT. Ravenskill Town Square - Day]

[Nafaryus:]

The admiration
The applause and the cheers
I am impressed
You've brought us all to tears

To think I didn't notice
The way you looked at her
Now step down from your throne
And let me bring you back to earth

Need I remind you?
I am the ruler here
Don't overlook that fact

Swearing allegiance
To anyone but me
No, I won't put up with that

Hide and protect him
Send him away
I'll never play this game

Stand by your savior
One thing remains
I'll find him just the same

[Imperial Guards:]

Brace yourself
Bow down to Nafaryus

Pray for help
Kneel before Nafaryus

[Nafaryus:]

He'll surrender on his own
If not, there'll be hell to pay
I'll tear down this city stone by stone
You only have three days

Send home the rebels
Call off the fight
In no uncertain terms

Should you refuse me
Fear for your lives
Ravenskill shall burn

[Imperial Guards:]

Brace yourself
Bow down to Nafaryus

Pray for help
Kneel before Nafaryus

[Narrator:]

With this frightening decree
Nafaryus departs
They're left to weigh the gravity
Of his threatening remarks

Judgement day will soon arrive
In only three days time
Will Gabriel get out of this alive?
This remains the question on their minds

"Brother, Can You Hear Me?"

[EXT. Ravenskill Rebel Command - Day]

[Arhys & Rebel Militia]

Brother can you hear me?
Your life is in my hands
I will not surrender
Never yield to his demands
If we stand together
We will never fall
Brother we're the answer to your call

Brother can you hear me?
You must not be afraid
I will march beside you
Have no fear
Be strong
Be brave

We sing the song of freedom
Our voices will resound
Brother we will never let you down

[Gabriel:]

On the road to revolution
We're bound to make mistakes
There's a price that we must pay
For every choice we make

Freedom is a reason
To stand up or give in
But someone has to lose
And someone has to win

Brother can you hear me?
I am not afraid
I will not forsake you
I'll be strong and I'll be brave
I sing the song of freedom
My courage knows no bounds
Brother now I stand on solid ground
Brother I will never let you down
Never let you down

"A Life Left Behind"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Faythe:]

I never knew
Someone was out there
A long way from nowhere
Who could open my eyes

All of this time
While I was sleeping
The world changed around me
Now I've never felt more alive

I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up

[Arabelle:]

Fate found a way
To bring them together
Once and forever
And won't let them go

Nothing I say
Can keep her from leaving
Her life has new meaning
I lost her a long time ago

[Faythe:]

I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up

I'm waking up
Now that yesterday's gone
Won't close my eyes again
I'm waking up

I'll plan to return well disguised
Make sure that I'm not recognized
Tomorrow a new sun will rise
And somehow I'll find you

Nothing will stand in my way
Soon I will see you again

I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up

I'm waking up
Now that yesterday's gone
Won't close my eyes again
I will never look back
I'm waking up

[Arabelle:]

You'll be her shadow as she moves my son
But she can never know you're there
She is alone and rebel guards are everywhere

[Daryus:]

I'll keep her safe from all danger
Won't let her out of my sight

Did I fail to mention my honest intentions?
This is the chance I deserve
Heed my words justice will be served

"Ravenskill"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Narrator:]

Morning breaks beyond the night
And she's a world away
Through crowded streets
This quiet hooded stranger makes her way

[Faythe:]

Please, excuse me
Sir can you help me?
Where can I find this man?

[Townsperson:]

Sorry, can't speak
Someone is waiting

[Faythe:]

Yes, I understand

[Narrator:]

As her will
Starts to fade
And all but disappears

Like a ghost
Suddenly a boy is standing there
And all is clear

[Faythe:]

I'm your friend
Trust me don't be scared
I am looking for your father and I promise
I can help
Now take my hand
We haven't time to spare

[Narrator:]

Hopeful and innocent
Sensing no danger
He sees humanity
Behind the stranger's eyes

Her true identity
Will be revealed when she sheds her disguise

[EXT. Rebel Training Camp - Day]

[Faythe:]

My intentions are faithful
There's a chance we can still end this game
I'd be forever grateful
To see him once again

[Arhys:]

You dare to stand
Before my eyes
You're one of them
Why would I trust you?

[Faythe:]

It's not like that
I can't go back
Hope fades away
With each passing second

Lost in this moment
Is where I want to stay
This can't be broken
We need to find a way
Gabriel

I would wait a lifetime
Just to see your face
But all we have is one more day

[Gabriel:]

I remember your father was moved by my song
I know when he sees we're united that he'll understand
We will walk this road together
We will face this hand in hand

With music and love on our side we can't lose this fight
Tomorrow our dream comes alive

"Chosen"

[INT. Gabriel's Hideout - Night]

[Gabriel:]

Her words ring true
Her message clear
How can he hear
Through all the noise and dissonance?

I've seen a sign
That he can change
If given just a chance

Against all hope
We found a way
And it is all because she trusts in me

Why have a gift
You can't embrace
When all you need is faith

And there's a reason now I see
The reason I've been chosen
She sees the light inside of me
A reason to believe

But I can't climb this mountain without you
No I can't face this on my own
With you by my side we will open his eyes
And the truth will deliver us home

And there's a reason now I see
The path that he has chosen
He fears the light inside of me

In the absence of song
He's forgotten right from wrong
Our voices will release him
He's refused to listen far too long

I'm convinced beyond a doubt
There can be no other way
He just has to hear me out
There's so much I need to say

But I can't climb this mountain without you
No I can't face this on my own
With you by my side we will open his eyes
And the truth will deliver us home

[Daryus:]

Trustful boy
Unaware who's watching
Open the door
I am right behind you

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night]

[Daryus:]

Don't resist me child
There's no use in fighting
We'll be here a while
Do you recognize me?

Look into my eyes
I'm the face of freedom
When daddy does arrive
He's in for a surprise

[Arhys:]

How dare you step inside my home!

[Daryus:]

His life is in my hands

[Arhys:]

You monster leave my son alone!

[Daryus:]

You do know who I am
Your love for him is strong

[Arhys:]

He's just a boy
He's done no wrong
This fight's not his to lose
I have everything you want

[Daryus:]

Your next decision
Will decide his fate
So listen to the words I have to say

Give up The Chosen One
And you will guarantee your son
Lives the life you never had

Wealth and prosperity
Beyond what you have ever seen
And best of all Xander will be free

He'll never want again
It's such an easy choice
Just think about your son

And I won't have to stand
In Faythe's dark shadow anymore
I am through with being pushed aside
Tired of fighting for my father's pride

Take the evening to decide

"The X Aspect"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night]

[Arhys:]

Betray my blood
To save my son
A hopeless choice to make

But who am I
If not the one
Who's meant to keep him safe?

Is trust and loyalty still justified
If I deny him of a better life?

Gabriel
Has always been
The strength I call upon

But nothing breaks
A father's will
To do what must be done

Should I turn my back on him?
Abandon all our plans for revolution?
Will hope and freedom die by morning light?

Evangeline
I swore to you
To love and guide our son

Destiny
Has shown his face
And now the time has come

Desperation blinds me
And through these bloodstained eyes I see the light
A better life is worth this sacrifice

"A New Beginning"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Faythe:]

Father I implore you
Don't believe a word
He is not the enemy
That is just absurd

You may see his talent
As some kind of threat
But I knew we were meant to be
From the day we met

Give us both a chance
For a new beginning
Nothing would mean more to me

He is just a man
Can't you show him mercy?
Sympathy and strength go hand in hand

[Nafaryus:]

This man's a fraud and a hoax
He'll only shatter your hopes
Saddest of all is to watch how you fall
For this person who you hardly know

[Faythe:]

Ignorant and stubborn
You have no respect
Not just for your flesh and blood
But all who you protect

Listen without judgement
Keep an open mind
If you cannot see the truth
You're the one who's blind

We don't stand a chance
That is his opinion
Mother can you talk to him?

[Arabelle:]

Try to understand
How they must be feeling
Misery's to know what might have been

[Nafaryus:]

Why would I ever concede
To listen to this fool? How can you be so naive?
You must be living in a world of make believe
Do you really think this charlatan is who he claims to be?

[Arabelle:]

Not long ago there was a time and place
You too possessed the same desires as Faythe

You knew how it felt to feel invisible
Music calmed your soul just like a drug
Remember Bug?

[Faythe:]

Father is it true
Bug was always you?
Finally I can reveal
How music makes me feel

Now you understand
Why I was hiding
This changes everything

[Nafaryus:]

I will grant the chance
For a new beginning
In the end the final word rests with me

"The Road To Revolution"

[INT. Gabriel's Hideout - Day]

[Faythe:]

He only sees what he desires to see
It took a while but finally he agreed
Though everything may not turn out as planned
If love's a risk
It's worth the chance

[Gabriel:]

I know where there is faith there's always hope
We'll meet beneath the stars at Heaven's Cove
Where ghosts of yesterday
Once filled the lighted stage
Taking our first step down a new road

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Daryus:]

Arhys time is running out
What will your decision be?
If you still have any doubt
Think about Evangeline

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]

On the road to revolution
Our salvation's never free
There's a price for liberation when you stand for your beliefs

When the man in the mirror
Takes a long hard look at me
Will the person staring back, be the man I want to be?

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Nafaryus:]

Change my mind?
A waste of time
For soon he will be mine

Brace yourself my brother
I have breaking news
The Noise Machines lie still tonight
There's no time to lose

No more threats of bloodshed
No more pain and fear
Ravenskill will brave the storm
Our victory is near

You are acting very strange
Nervous and on edge
I will be a voice for change
Brother give me strength

[Arhys:]
Burning rose, secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death, blood revenge
Moment of betrayal

I have sworn to live and die
By the warrior's code
Never leave a man behind
May God redeem my soul

I will give you what you need
My brother for my son
Guilt and shame will burden me
Until my days are done

Meet me tonight where the stars touch the sky
He'll be alone there with nowhere to hide

Burning rose, secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death, blood revenge
Moment of betrayal

He will be defenseless
I'll look on, say I put up a fight
There will be no witness
They will call you a hero tonight

Burning rose, secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death, blood revenge
Moment of betrayal

Threats and lies, changing sides
Moment of betrayal
Risking all, savior's fall
Moment of betrayal

[Narrator:]

Under the glow of the midnight moon
Where the stars touch the sky
Stand the long forgotten remains of a time gone by

Heaven's Cove was a wondrous site
Once a beautiful place
Now an empty shell like a memory that time erased

As the pivotal moment draws closer
Every shadow and whisper ignite
Music will rise like a phoenix from the ashes on this night

"Begin Again"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Faythe:]

I gave up hope
Was dead inside
Stayed lost within a world I chose to hide
Then I found my faith in him
And now I can
Begin again

I once believed
Our fate was sealed
But now at last the truth has been revealed
In an instant life could change
And now and then
Begin again

I know that I am meant for something more
That life beyond these walls
Has greater things in store

When I heard his voice I realized
I'd never be the same
Instantly I knew my life had changed

I dream of peace
Above all else
To share a world where we could be ourselves
We must learn to rise above the past
Before we can at last
Begin again

"The Path That Divides"

[EXT. Heaven's Cove Ampitheater - Night]

[Narrator:]

The evening stars shine brightly
Over heaven's cove
As night descends in silence
The fated scene unfolds
Consumed with trepidation
Arhys hears his brother's voice

[Gabriel's Voice:]

As you're facing the path that divides
I will always be here by your side

[Arhys:]
I feel my pulse begin to race
Beads of sweat drip down my face
I have made a grave mistake
What have I done?
My blood for my son?

It's not too late
I won't betray him

[Daryus:]

I knew the day had come
And you could be tempted
To give up The Chosen One
And finally end this
Do anything for your son
A terminal weakness
But now you're as good as done

[Arhys:]
I didn't have a choice
And I was defenseless
I didn't believe his voice
And fighting was senseless
But now I can see the truth
I've come to my senses
I shouldn't have trusted you

[Narrator:]

Arhys was never aware
His son had followed him there
Confused and deathly afraid
X watched his hero be brave

[Arhys:]

On the path that divides
You were there by my side
There will be no betrayal tonight

I found courage and strength
In the words you once sang
Tore the truth from the lies
On the path that divides

[Daryus:]

You dare defy your prince?
Well you just threw your life away
Along with Xander's dreams
You chose the wrong man to betray

[Narrator:]

Two hungry warriors
Clash in the shadows of the night
But there's a cost with every fight
And Arhys' fight for hope
Cost him his very life

My father's dead
Your day will come

Don't hold your breath
The night's still young
Confront your death
Like father, like son

Who's this I see?
Approaching me
The Chosen One?

[Narrator:]

Drawing closer pace by pace
The walking shadow hides its face
Never aware of the looming attack
Like stepping right into a trap

As his weapon
Finds its victim
Mortified,
He's shocked to find
The shadow is Faythe

Angels above
Have you deceived my eyes?
Be still my love
I won't leave your side

All my life
I have walked alone
Now I've found my home in you
Only I'm too late

Have I wandered into someone's nightmare?
This is more than any heart can bear

You stole my brother's life
How many more have to die
Before you will open your eyes?

Don't leave me now
Hold on for one more breath
Stay strong somehow
This can't be the end

All your life
You have walked alone
Now I am your home
So take my hand and don't let go

Crushing pain and crippling grief
Nothing like I've ever felt
God above and souls beneath
Hear my last farewell

"Losing Faythe"

[EXT. Heaven's Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Nafaryus:]

My foolish pride
My selfish heart
Lost in the dark
Blinded by my arrogance

And now you beg for one last breath
And I'm the one to blame

There's a reason now I see
The reason you have chosen
To find the light inside of me
If only I believed

[Arabelle:]

Here I am
Don't be afraid
I will never let you slip away

Look my way
You must be brave
Find the strength to live for one more day

I will keep from losing Faythe
I will ask for grace
And hope will find a way

[Narrator:]

Like a candle's dying flame
With forgiving eyes
She starts to drift away

[Nafaryus:]

Gabriel, my son
I see the tide is turning
Can The Chosen One
Keep her fire burning?

I would trade my life
Just for one last moment

Use your gift I beg
May life begin again
May life begin again

"Whispers On The Wind"

[EXT. Heaven's Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Gabriel:]

If I still had something left
I'd surely use my gift
To give her one more breath
To see her smile again
And yet my gift is gone
Along with all her dreams
It vanished with a scream
My fragile voice has all but disappeared
I've nothing left to give
The words I wish I'd said
Just whispers on the wind
And now all hope is dead

"Hymn Of A Thousand Voices"

[EXT. Heaven's Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Narrator:]

Out of the shadows
One by one they came
To shed their light upon his moment of doubt and pain

A thousand voices
Rang out through the night
A symphony of mercy for their savior
Too tired to fight

And as the chorus grew
A thousand hearts beat true
Then like a glowing beacon in the dark
Hope came shining through

Amazingly the savior found his voice
And all together they rejoiced

[Gabriel and Townspeople:]

Glorious sound
Guide her tonight
Out of the darkness
Into the light

Merciful song
Set her soul free
Unbind the chains of endless sleep

Choirs on high
Grant her new life
Make me a vessel of thy boundless grace
Music has shown her the way
She lives today!

Like your father once said
Life is not what you're given
It is how you decide to live
On the path you have chosen

So together we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

[Faythe:]

I know you're scared and alone
But we will face this together
Through the innocence in your eyes
They will live on forever

In their memory we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

[Gabriel, Faythe and X:]

We'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

Together we'll build a new world

We'll build a new world
A bold new world

"Astonishing"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Arhys' Spirit:]
Brother, can you hear me?
His life is in your hands
He is just a child and still too young to understand
Show him love and courage
That freedom knows no bounds
Tell him he could never let me down

[Xander:]
Father, I will make you proud
Rest in peace

[Gabriel:]
I always had the answer
All this time I held the key
And now that I see
The reason to believe
I can be the man who I am meant to be

[Faythe:]
Because of you I live again
Now I can be a voice for change
And help to build a world that's fair and true
So they can live the life they never knew

[Nafaryus:]
On the road to revolution
There are lessons to be learned
All the things you thought that mattered
Are lost at every turn

When the light of my existence
Was slipping through my hands
Pride and ignorance receded
To reveal a humbled man

[Arabelle:]
My prince, my son,
You got lost along the way
In light of this new burden that you face
You are forgiven on this day

[Ensemble:]
People, can you hear us?
Peace has been restored
The silence has been broken
Music reigns forever more

We sing a song of freedom
Together we are bound
People, we shall never hold you down
We will build our world on common ground

And we'll live once more
Eternally
In harmony
Our lives will be
Astonishing
Again

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden within
Open wounds hidden under my skin

Pain is real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Staring at me crying

[CHORUS]
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I sever myself from the world
and shut down completely
All alone in my own living hell
overcome with irrational fear

Under the weight of the world on my chest
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath
Tell me I'm not dying

[CHORUS]
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I'm a burden and a travesty
I'm a prisoner of regret
Between the flashbacks and the violent dreams
I am hanging on the edge

Disaster lurks around the bend
Paradise came to an end
And no magic pill
can bring it back again

[CHORUS]
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

"The Looking Glass"

I would not expect you felt unnoticed and ignored
Better to rise above the clouds Then be a stranger in the crowd
All that you protected doesn’t matter anymore
Rather be stripped of all your pride
Than watch your dreams be cast aside

You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying stardom
Singing your own praise

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You are not content with being nameless and unknown
Trying to rise above the fray
Eager to give it all away

Some will not admit that 15 minutes have expired
Too much attention much too soon
Don’t see you walking on the moon

You are caught up in your gravity
Bathing in the spotlight
Imitating fame

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying madness
Singing your own praise

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

"The Bigger Picture"

Long before the colors start to bleed
I can see the painting come alive
Clever like an angel in disguise 
Moving in and out of reach 

If the candle lights this crooked path
Like a lighthouse peering through the haze
I will find the river through the rain 
And I’ll reach the water’s edge 

Shed your light on me
Be my eyes when I can’t see 
Shed your light on me 
Be my guide so I can see
The Bigger Picture 

Like a moth burned by the fire 
and driven to the flame 
(Prophecies’ a blessing and a curse) 
I must bare this cross alone
There’s no one else to blame 
With each treasure found
Another shipwreck’s washed ashore
I am carried by the current
On a slow and steady course 

[CHORUS] 

What If caught in a moment 
I get lost and can't find my way
What if all along i was wrong 
In every turn, In every way 

Would you talk me off the ledge 
Or let me take the fall 
Better to try and fail 
then to never try at all 

You look but cannot see
Talk but never speak
You live but cannot breathe
See but don’t believe 

Wounds that never heal
A heart that cannot feel
A dream that’s all too real 
A stare as cold as steel

I’ve listened to the stories of resentment and disdain
I’ve looked into the empty eyes of anger, fear, and shame
I’ve taken blood from every stone 
And traveled every road 

When I see the distant lights illuminate the night
Then I will know I am home 

<|endoftext|>

"Behind The Veil"

What would possess you to justify
Such dark and twisted ways?
What kind of monster would come to feast
When the devil shows his face?
What does it take for life to change
And a mind to lose control?
Cruelly left you to suffer the blame
After all the lies you told

I am finding courage in my darkest hour
I am bent, not broken
Calling out

Someone save me, look behind the veil
Please don't walk away
Someone save me, bring me home tonight
I can't face another day

Can you see the stranger
Hiding in plain sight?
Feeding on the chaos
When the lightning strikes
There's no redemption
There's no being saved
There's no salvation
For a soul depraved

You are finding promise in your finest hour
You are bent, not broken
Calling out

<|endoftext|>

"Surrender To Reason"

In moments of pain 
Where heart and mind collide
Self reflection helps me decide
I believe the sacrifices in life
Give more than they take 

Visions flowing slowly shedding light
Memories swimming in the sea of time
Pieces to the puzzle falling into place
That with which we struggle through we’ve learned to embrace 

Love show the way, alter my state of mind
Wash away the sorrow 
Grace lead the way
When boundaries are found
Surrender to reason

Life gives you brighter days 
Through sacrifices made
My spirit travels like the wind and waves
My heart and mind unite
Mistakes resolved give sight 
The river’s currents slowly turns the stone 

Restless angels
Help me find my way
Restless angels 
Help me find my strength 

Restless angels 
Help me find my way
Restless angels 
Let love show the way
Let grace be the way 
Surrender to reason

"Along For The Ride"

At this moment words fail me
And my vision's unclear
Blind to the truth
Like hands reaching out in the darkness

[CHORUS]
I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride

Through the gift of surrender
I'm embracing the fight
Breaking the code
There's clarity on the horizon

[CHORUS]
I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride

I will not live under a shadow of fear
Never be crippled by chaos and doubt
Fall prey to your madness

I am not shattered
Out of the ashes I rise
Knowing that nothing is stronger than faith
Finding hope in our hopeless lives

[CHORUS]
I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride

I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride

"Illumination Theory"

[I. Paradoxe de la Lumière Noire]

[Instrumental]

[II. Live, Die, Kill]

Consider this question 
Look deep inside 
Deliver a true confession 
What are you willing to live for? 

Consider this question
Open your eyes 
Examine your own reflection 
What are you willing to die for? 

When your backs’ against the wall 
And the time's uncertain
Consider this question
No standing by
When flesh and blood are threatened 
What are you willing to kill for? 

We seek to understand
We cry with head in hand 

The bridges we build to connect 
The distance that makes us forget
Hate dividing us, love reminding us
Of our shared humanity 

Hope can be a shadow fleeting
I would rather die believing 
Capture it all in a final act of faith 

We seek to understand 
We cry with head in hand 

A story that needs to be told
An answer that begs to be found
The beauty we wish to behold
Is never too far away 

[III. The Embracing Circle]

[Instrumental]

[IV. The Pursuit Of Truth]

Mothers for their children
Husbands for their wives
Martyrs for the kingdom
Fighting for your life
A soldier for his country
A junkie for the high
Teachers for their students 
Vengeance for a crime
Rebels for their freedom
A tyrant for the praise
Cowards for salvation
Money, love, and fame

Noble and brave
Lay down our lives for the cause
Death over shame
Grace before glory 

[V. Surrender, Trust & Passion]

To really feel the joy in life
You must suffer through the pain
When you surrender to the light 
You can face the darkest days

If you open up your eyes
And you put your trust in love
On those cold and endless nights 
You will never be alone

Passion glows within your heart
Like a furnace burning bright 
Until you struggle through the dark
You’ll never know that you're alive

<|endoftext|>

"On The Backs Of Angels"

Standing on the backs of angels
Destined to create
Mounting the attack
While heroes carry your weight

We spiral towards disaster
Survival fading faster

Riding out the wave
Content to feed off the machine
Bleeding us to death
The new American dream

You're blinded by your hunger
Beware your days are numbered

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

Blurring lines drawn in between
What is right and what is wrong
Victims on the radar string us along

We're on to your agenda
The dead end road to nowhere

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

"Build Me Up, Break Me Down"

Today I will be your savior
Tomorrow ‒ a demon
You crave my erratic behavior
And watch my every move

Obsession at all cost
You'll be the death of me
Broken and torn apart
Why can't you let me be?

You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces
I crash and burn
I never learn
I'm your guilty addiction

Build me up
Break me down

Tonight I am the new messiah
You deify
When I'm no longer desired
I'll be crucified

The one who's free from sin
The first to cast the stone
Fighting the fear within
I won't be left alone

You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces
The price I pay
To live this way
And the fantasy stays alive

I can't live up
I can't let down
And leave you falling to pieces
I crash and burn
I never learn
I'm your morbid obsession.

Build me up
Break me down

You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces
The price I pay
To live this way
And the fantasy stays alive

I can't live up
I can't let down
And leave you falling to pieces
I crash and burn
I never learn
Your iconic fixation

Build me up
Break me down

Build me up
Break me down

"Lost Not Forgotten"

I am not immortal
I am just a man
A power-craving tyrant
Beyond the shadows in the sand

Men have come to fear me
Many bow and cry
Known across the desert
I am the one who will not die

I have faced the demons of our most desperate moments
I have been the one to defend our pride
I have worn the banner of my abandoned brothers
I will be the first one to give my live

Lost not forgotten
Reigning against the odds
Feared and respected living among the gods
Leading the empire
Spirit as black as coal
Lost not forgotten
King of the deathless soul

An Epic novel no one's read
Pages torn and faded
The greatest story never told

Behold the kingdom I possess
Land of wealth and beauty
Where the streets are paved with gold

Once fearless and brave
A realm passed away
The ghosts of yesterday

Lost not forgotten
Reigning against the odds
Feared and respected living among the gods
Leading the empire
Brutal and heartless
Vanishing further
Into the darkness
Lost not forgotten
King of the deathless soul

"This Is The Life"

In the heart of your most solemn barren night
When your soul's turned inside out
Have you questioned all the madness you invite?
What your life is all about

Some of us choose to live gracefully
Some can get caught in the maze
And lose their way home
This is the life we belong to
Our gift divine

Have you ever wished that you were someone else?
Traded places in your mind
It's only a waste of your time

Some of us choose to live gracefully
Some can get caught in the maze
And lose their way home
This is the life we belong to
Our gift divine

Feed the illusion you dream about
Cast out the monsters inside
Life begins with an empty slate
Fragile left in the hands of fate
Driven by love and crushed by hate
Until the day the gift is gone
And shadows remain

Some of us choose to live gracefully
Some can get caught in the maze
And lose their way home
Memories will fade
Time races on
What will they say after you're gone?
This is the life we belong to
Our gift divine
Our gift divine

"Bridges In The Sky"

Blackness awakens
Visions come alive
Seeing through darkness
With borrowed eyes

Death survivor
Take me higher
Reunite my soul

Whisperer of truth
I trust in you
To make me whole

Sun
Come shine my way
May healing waters bury all my pain

Wind
Carry me home
The fabric of reality is tearing apart
The piece of me that died
Will return
To live again

Feeling myself slip away
Suddenly dreaming awake
Hidden memories
Flooding back

I will not grow in the light
Until I pass through the darkest caverns of my heart

Dance with fire
Spirit guide erase the world outside

Messenger of truth
I trust in you
Transform me now

Sun
Come shine my way
May healing waters bury all my pain

Wind
Carry me home
The fabric of reality is tearing apart
The piece of me that died
Will return
To live again

And at last the time has come
To unite again as one

To the power of the Earth I'm calling
Crossing bridges in the sky
On a journey to renew my life
Shaman take my hand

"Outcry"

Somewhere overhead
Distant thunders roars
The revolution has begun
The war to end all wars

As I welcome death
I hear the battle cry
Bullets fall like fire
Raining from the sky

The rebel in us all
Someday gets tired
Of being pushed around
But freedom has a price
The cost is buried in the ground

We suffered far too long
We gather now growing stronger
We will not be ignored
Anymore any longer
Our anthem will guide us

Rise up, be counted
Stand strong and unite
Wait for the outcry
Resistance is calling tonight

Far too many years
Of chaos and unrest
Far too many voices
Brutally suppressed

We fight for what is just
For all that we believe
We fight till death or glory
Fight to be set free

The street are bathed in blood
Time to step down
And time to walk away
You'll never rule me now
Though you may stand upon my grave

You can look the other way
Or you can face the light
Although it seems so far away
Freedom's worth the fight

Rise up, be counted
Stand strong and unite
Wait for the outcry
Resistance is calling

Rise up, be counted
Stand strong and unite
Wait for the outcry
Resistance is calling tonight

The world watches on
While we risk our lives
Locked in a kingdom of fear
As our children die

"Far From Heaven"

No one truly has the answers
Every day I struggle through it once more
Keep things bottled up
Never speaking my mind
Misinterpreted I'm doing just fine

Every day I put a brave face on
Serves me well
Feeling helpless facing it alone
Hard to tell
That I can't change who I am
How I feel there's no end

I have done
What you asked of me
Leaves me nothing to live for

Coming undone
Way too high a price
I should pay
You keep your pride
While I die inside
Every day
No I
Can't lie anymore
Won't pretend
I've done
All I can

You can't imagine
The hell I'm going through
Not asking you to save me
I'm too far from heaven

Nothing you can do to change me
But accept me as I am

"Breaking All Illusions"

With the sun in place
There's a test of faith
Streams of thought awaken

New realities
Singularities
Breaking all illusions

[Spoken words:]
“Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.”
“Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.”

Sudden bust of heat
Burning source of life
Masterful destruction

Power's not an act
It's understanding truth
Changing my direction

Live in the moment
Breathe in a new beginning
Wisdom revealed
As I unlearn to learn

Life's biggest battles
Often are fought alone
My spirit brings me home

Emerald thoughts flow through my consciousness
Drawn to curses left behind
Test of will the threshold to one's faith
Starts a fire in the mind

Searching out
Reaching in
To arrive
Where I began
Sights remembered
In the light

Searching out
Reaching in
To arrive
Where I began
Sights remembered
Come alive

Embrace the days
Don't turn away
Life's true intent needs patience
Karma starts the signal

"Beneath The Surface"

Is there ever really a right time?
You had led me to believe
Someday you'd be there for me
When the stars above aligned
When you weren't so consumed
I kept looking for the clues
So I waited in the shadows of my heart
And still the time was never right

Until one day I stopped caring
And began to forget why I longed to be so close
And I disappeared into the darkness
And the darkness turned to pain
And never went away
Until all that remained was buried, deep beneath the surface

A shell of what things could've been
Tired bones beneath a veil of guarded secrets all too frail
Sad to think I never knew
You were searching for the words
For the moment to emerge
Yet the moment never came
You couldn't risk my fragile frame

Until one day you stopped caring
And began to forget why you tried to be so close
And you disappeared into the darkness
And the darkness turned to pain
And never went away
Until all that remained was buried, deep beneath the surface

I would scream just to be heard
As if yelling at the stars
I was bleeding just to feel
You would never say a word
Kept me reaching in the dark
Always something to conceal

Until one day I stopped caring
And began to forget why I longed to be so close
And I disappeared into the darkness
And the darkness turned to pain
And never went away
Until all that remained was buried, deep beneath the surface
Beneath the surface

"A Nightmare To Remember"

A nightmare to remember
I'd never be the same.
What began as laughter
So soon would turn to pain.
The sky was clear and frigid
The air was thick and still
Now I'm not one to soon forget
And I bet I never will

Picture for a moment
The perfect irony
A flawless new beginning
Eclipsed by tragedy.
The uninvited stranger
Started dancing on his own
So we said goodbye
To the glowing bride
And we made our way back home.

Life was so simple then
We were so innocent.
Father and mother
Holding each other.

Without warning
Out of nowhere
Like a bullet
From the night
Crushing Glass
Rubber and steel
Scorching fire
Glowing lights
Screams of terror
Pain and Fear
Sounds of sirens
Smoke in my eyes
Sudden stillness
Blackened silence
No more screaming
No more cries

Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed

Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed

Lying on the table
In this unfamiliar place
I'm greeted by a stranger
A man without a face
He said, "Son, do you remember?
Do you even know your name?"
Then he shined a light into my eyes
And said, "take this for the pain."

Hopelessly drifting,
Bathing in beautiful agony.
I am endlessly falling,
Lost in this wonderful misery.
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
And all of the panic inside starts to fade.
Hopelessly drifting,
Bathing in beautiful agony.

"Tell me does this hurt you?"
Said the faceless man.
"Can you move all of your fingers?
Can you try your best to stand?"
I asked about the others
Is everyone OK?
He told me not to worry
As he turned and looked away.

Hopelessly drifting,
Bathing in beautiful agony.
I am endlessly falling,
Lost in this wonderful misery.
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
And all of the panic inside starts to fade.
Hopelessly drifting,
Bathing in beautiful agony.

Day after day
And night after night
Replaying the events
Did they ever see the red light?

Over and over
Scene by scene
Like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams.
How can you prepare for what would happen next?
No son should ever have to see his father such a mess
It's a miracle he lived
It's a blessing no one died
By the Grace of God above
Everyone survived

Life was so simple then
We were so innocent.
It will stay with us forever
A nightmare to remember

"A Rite Of Passage"

Since the new world order
Played upon our fears
Spreading accusations
Of radical ideas

The brotherhood of wisdom
Strength and dignity
Its rituals and secrets
Remain a mystery

Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key
Walk through the gate
The great ascent
To reach a higher state
A rite of passage

The final stage
A sacred home
Unlock the door
And lay the corner stone
A rite of passage

Men of wealth and power
Influence and fame
Philosophers and leaders
Are members of the trade

Bound by oath and honor
Like the rose and cross
An enigmatic union
Of esoteric thought

Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key
Walk through the gate
The great ascent
To reach a higher state
A rite of passage

The final stage
A sacred home
Unlock the door
And lay the corner stone
A rite of passage

Turn the key
Walk through the gate
The great ascent
To reach a higher state
A rite of passage

The seven stars
The rising sun
A perfect world
Where new life has begun
A rite of passage

"Wither"

Let it out, let it out
Fill the empty space
So insecure
Find the words
And let it out

Staring down, staring down
Nothing comes to mind
Find the place
Turn the water into wine

But I feel I'm getting nowhere
And I'll never see the end

So I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I break down
And let the story guide me

Turn it on
Turn it on
Let the feelings flow
Close your eyes
See the ones you used to know

Open up open up
Don't struggle to relate
Lure it out
Help the memory escape
Still this barrenness consumes me
And I feel like giving up

So I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I break down
And let the story guide me

I wither
And give myself away

Like reflections on the page
The world's what you create

I drown in hesitation
My words come crashing down
And all my best creations
Burn into the ground
The thought of starting over
Leaves me paralyzed

Tear it out again
Another one that got away

I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear

I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I break down
And let the story guide me
I wither
And give myself away

Like reflections on the page
The world's what you create

"The Shattered Fortress"

[X. Restraint]

Freedom calls my name
Serenity keeps me sane
Happiness -- it dulls the pain

Honest to see my place
Open to other ways
Willingness to understand

Justice but do not judge
Courtesy for others' flaws
Kindness -- it's not that hard

Self-restraint of tongue and pen
Inventory -- my daily friend
Analysis let down your guard

Look in the mirror
What do you see?
The shattered fortress
That once bound me

Faithful ascent, through darkest fires
I've found the path to take me higher

You're smart enough for me to trust go live your life now
Just keep these steps in your life and you'll know how
If you're not sure, ask yourself,
"Have I done to them as I would have them do to me?"

Look in the mirror
What's that you see?
The shattered fortress
Fly now be free

Faithful ascent, through darkest fires
I've found the path to take me higher

I once thought it better to be right
But now I have finally seen the light
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn from mistakes
I live with serenity now
Not self-righteous hate

[XI. Receive]

(Help me be a channel of Thy peace
That where there is hatred, I may bring love;
That where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness;
That where there is discord, I may bring harmony;
That where there is error, I may bring truth;
That where there is doubt, I may bring faith)

Now that you can see all you have done
(That where there is despair, I may bring hope;
That where there are shadows, I may bring light)

It's time to take that step into the kingdom
(That where there is sadness, I may bring joy)

All your sins will help to make you strong
(That I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted.
That I may seek to understand than to be understood)

And help you break right through the prison wall
(That I may seek to love, rather than to be loved,
for it is by self-forgetting that one finds,
it is by forgiving that one is forgiven)

Keep all of me,
The desires that once burned me deep inside
Help me live today
And help to give me grace
To carry out your way

I am ready, help me be all I can be
I am ready, help guide me and keep me free

[XII. Responsible]

I am responsible when anyone, anywhere
Reaches out for help, I want my hand to be there
I am responsible when anyone, anywhere
Reaches out for help, I want my hand to be there

"The Best Of Times"

Remember days of yesterday
How it flew so fast
The two score and a year we had,
I thought it would always last
Those summer days and west coast dreams
I wished would never end
A young boy and his father,
Idol and best friend

I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
A lifetime together
I'll never forget

The morning shows on the radio
The case of the missing dog
Lying on the pillows at the old 812
Watching Harold and Maude
The record shops, the stickball fields
My home away from home
And when we weren't together
The hours on the phone

I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
I'll cherish them forever
The best of times

But then came the call
Our lives changed forever more
"You can pray for a change
But prepare for the end..."

The fleeting winds of time
Flying through each day
All the things I should've done
But time just slipped away
Remember seize the day
Life goes by in the blink of an eye
With so much left to say

These were the best of times
I'll miss these days
Your spirit lit my life each day

Thank you for the inspiration
Thank you for the smiles
All the unconditional love
That carried me for miles
It carried me for miles
But most of all thank you for my life

These were the best of times
I'll miss these days
Your spirit lit my life each day
My heart is bleeding bad
But I'll be OK
Your spirit guides my life each day

"The Count Of Tuscany"

Several years ago
In a foreign town
Far away from home
I met the Count of Tuscany

A young eccentric man
Bred from royal blood
Took me for a ride
Across the open countryside

Get into my car
Let's go for a drive
Along the way
I'll be your guide
Just step inside

Maybe you recall
A cannibal curator
A character inspired by my brother's life

Winding through the hills
The city far behind
On and on we drove
Down narrow streets and dusty roads

At last we came upon
A picturesque estate
On sprawling emerald fields
An ancient world of times gone by

Let me introduce
My brother
A bearded gentleman
Historian
Sucking on his pipe
Distinguished accent
Making me uptight
No accident

I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die

Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive

I-
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Would you like to see
Our secret holy place?
I come here late at night
To pray to him by candle light

Then peering through the glass
I saw with disbelief
Still dressed in royal clothes
The saint behind the altar

History recalls
During times of war
Legend has been traced
Back inside these castle walls

Where soldiers came to hide
In barrels filled with wine
Never to escape
These tombs of oak are where they died

Down the cellar stairs
I disappear
Like the angel's share
The end is near

Come and have a taste
A rare vintage
All the finest wines
Improve with age

I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive

I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Could this be the end?
Is this the way I die?
Sitting here alone
No one by my side

I don't understand
I don't feel that I deserve this
What did I do wrong?
I just don't understand

Give me one more chance
Let me please explain
It's all been circumstance
I'll tell you once again

You took me for a ride
Promising a vast adventure
Next thing that I know
I'm frightened for my life

Now wait a minute man
That's not how it is
You must be confused
That isn't who I am

Please don't be afraid
I would never try to hurt you
This is how we live
Strange although it seems
Please try to forgive

The chapel and the saint
The soldiers and the wine
The fables and the tales
All handed down through time

Of course you're free to go
Go and tell the world my story
Tell about my brother
Tell them about me
The Count of Tuscany...

[I Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[II Resurrection]

I saw a white light
Shining there before me
And walking to it
I waited for the end
A final vision
Promising salvation
A resurrection
For a fallen man

Do you still wait for your God
And the symbol of your faith?

I can free you from this Hell and misery
You should never be ashamed my son
I can give you power beyond anything
Trust me you will be the chosen one

I was forgotten
A body scorned and broken
My soul rejected
Tainted by his blood

Beyond redemption
A sinner not worth saving
Forever taken
From the one I loved

Do I still wait for my God
And a symbol of my faith?

I can lead you down the path and back to life
All I ask is that you worship me
I can help you seek revenge and save yourself
Give you life for all eternity

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their saviour's calling
Of this wicked day

Through a veil of madness
With a vicious blade
One man rises up
Standing in their way

Redemption
Redemption for humanity

"Forsaken"

For a while I thought I fell asleep
Lying motionless inside a dream

Then rising suddenly
I felt a chilling breath upon me
She softly whispered in my ear
(Forsaken)

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand
Give yourself up to me

I waited painfully
For night to fall again
Trying to silence the fear within me

Out of an ivory mist
I felt a stinging kiss
And saw a crimson stain on her lips

I have to know your name
Where have I seen your face before?
My dear one don't you be afraid

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand
Give yourself up to me

Take me far away
Close your eyes
And hold your breath
To the ends of the earth

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand

Forsaken
Fly away with me tonight
Awaken
Renew my life
Now you are mine
Give yourself up to me

"Constant Motion"

Tunnel vision at blinding speed
Controlling my thoughts, obsessing me
Void of any uncertainty
Throughout my very soul

Lost illusions of mind control
Resisting all hope of letting go
Racing impulse of dark desire
Drives me through the night

I try to shut it down
It leaves me in the dust
No matter what I've found
I can never get enough

Frantic actions of insanity
Impulsive laced profanity
Long for elusive serenity
Way out of my control

Traveling through both space and time
(Out of body, out of mind)
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
(I can't let up, I can't let go)
Can't stop this flame from burning
Forever more
Into the night
Blistering

Focus here, focus there
Cannot see the light
(Falling down through the night)
Sprawling everywhere

Searching left, searching right
(Panic setting in, I can no longer fight)
When will this end?

Accelerate, dislocate
(Set to crash and burn, haven't got time to waste)
Not planning to return

Aggravate, agitate
(When will I ever learn?)
There's no way out of here
Nowhere to turn

Obsessive yearning
Compulsive burning
Still never learning
Insane random thoughts
Of neat disorder

Scattered wasteland surrounding me
Tattered memories of what used to be
Apocalyptic mind debris
Until we meet again

Traveling through both space and time
(Out of body, out of mind)
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
(I can't let up, I can't let go)
Can't stop this flame from burning
Forever more
Into the night
Blistering

Traveling through both space and time
(Out of body, out of mind)
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
(I can't let up, I can't let go)
Can't stop this flame from burning
Can't stop the wheels from turning

Traveling through both space and time
(You get yours, and I got mine)
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
(I can't let up, I can't let go)
Can't stop this flame from burning
Forever more
Into the night
Blistering

"The Dark Eternal Night"

No one dared to
Speak of the terrible danger
The hideous ancient warnings
Forged in the void of night

He has risen up
Out of the blackness chaos
The last of the prophets sinister
A sickening monstrous sight

Through the stifling heat
Underneath the pale green moon

I burned with a thirst
To seek things not yet seen

Climbing endless stairs
Leading to the choking room

Eager to explore
His most shocking mysteries

Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night

Black forces
Rage in the vortex,
Fighting
Waves of destruction
Swallowing
The echo of the universe

I am the last
Born of the blood of the pharaohs
The ultimate god of a rotting creation
Sent to unleash this curse

Restless crowds draw near
Nameless hooded forms appear

Amidst fallen ruins
Grotesque creatures battle

Shadowed on a screen
Yellow evil faces leer

Vacant monuments
Corpses of dead worlds left behind

Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night

Trapped in a hellish dream
Spinning past worlds unseen
And frightfully vanishing
Into the dark eternal night

[Solos]

Drifting beyond all time

"Repentance"

[VIII Regret]
Hello, mirror, so glad to see you my friend
It's been a while...

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage running through my head
Patterns of my life I thought adorned me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament

Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life
that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking about the dreaded task in store for me
A pit of fear at the thought of my amends

Hoping that this step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this unswept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

[IX Restitution]

"Until that moment, I'd never felt like I'd failed at anything...And I felt like I failed her...And I failed myself, and I failed my children...It's still really hard to deal with."

"I want to thank you for helping me to see my own selfishness and to tell you how regretful I am it has hurt you."

"I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital, Grandpa when you were on your deathbed. I'm sorry I didn't come to your funeral...I don't know if I was selfish or just too scared to face it. It's one of the biggest regrets of my life."

"I'm here to confess with you that what I did, was wrong... And I'm asking for your forgiveness..."

"The only unforgivable thing hauls itself out of bed, looks over my shoulder at the bloody English weather..."

"I really regret not being able to see my friend Andy..."

"One of my best friends who's the godfather of my daughter, he asked me to sing or play something at his wedding, and I turned it down because I was busy and too much of a chicken shit to do it...And I feel sorry for that, because it was a very very close friend of mine..."

"So, I wanted to apologize to anyone that I've upset or offended.. they're just words, it's just an opinion, but unfortunately, I tend to express it as a fact, and that's kind of arrogant. Isn't it?"

"I think it's the betrayal...it still haunts me."

"I'm sorry for what I did back then... I was a different person. I really was and I'm so sorry. I wish it wouldn't have happened, but it did, and I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'm sorry..."

"I guess I'm simply sorry for being me and not you. I so often wish you could be here with me to show me the way..."

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development, we will be amazed before we are half way through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace.
No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.

Are these extravagant promises? We think not. They are being fulfilled among us - sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. They will always materialize if we work for them.

"You're only as sick as your secrets, but the truth shall set you free..."

"The truth is the truth and the only thing you can do is to live with it."

<|endoftext|>

"Prophets Of War"

It burns deep down inside of me,
We have ourselves to blame.
Not questioning, accepted as the truth.

Debate this fight it's just cause
The facts do not support theirs
To liberate a people
And rid them of tyrant rule

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?

It's time to make a change.

Intrigued
Got your attention - deceived
Since the inception - our brave
Fight for what reason

Compelled
Can we clean up this mess?
The loss of loved ones
A perverse request
They continue the same rhetoric
These derelicts that profit
Win or lose

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?
It's time to make a change

Time for change
Fight the fear
Find the truth
Time for change

The only thing
That I believe
Will help us see this through is faith.
Pray they will forgive,
Forgive our arrogance,
So we can make it right,
Right what they have wronged.

See you sweat
Unexpected, controversial
Get used to it
Things are gonna get personal
Your sympathy
A pitiful display you stutter
Your empathy
Means nothing if there is no honor
Responsible
Of this you are incapable
We implicate
Incriminate - Exacerbate - Too much at stake

Our Fathers, Mothers
Sisters, Brothers
Sons and Daughters
Forced
Perpetuating their ideals
A mindless act
To stay the course

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?
Is it time to make a change?
A change from what it's been
Can we help them break away?
Is our patience wearing thin?
It's time to make a change

Time for change
Fight the fear
Find the truth
Time for change

"The Ministry Of Lost Souls"

The water's edge
Is where she waits
Lost soul still wandering
Meant to die
But she's stuck not crossing over

The other side
Is where he waits
His spirit reaching out
Meant to save
But she's too scared
to take his hand

Living in a world without you
(drowning in the past)
Is living in no world at all
So now I call on you

Remember me?
I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering
was all in vain
It's almost over now
Don't turn your back on paradise

Feeling scared, she's prepared
To give up everything
She can't stand
to feel like half of her is fading

He will choose
the only way
To rid her of her pain
Take her soul now
The decision has been made

Living in a world without love
(a burden to my soul)
Is living in a worthless world
So I will call on you...

Remember me?
I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering
was all in vain
It's almost over
Remember me?
You were so young
How could I tell you?
Remember me?
I am the one
Who saved your life that night

I was the one
who would not abandon you
Even in death
I was the one
who would not leave you
I used my freedom to protect you
And all the while direct you
Do you remember me this time?
Even in death I gave you life
I gave you life

I wanted to deserve a place
A place beside you
This time when I reached out my hand
It reached all the way to heaven

Remember me?
I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering
was all in vain
It's almost over now
Goodbye
It's almost over now
Goodbye

It's time
I release you from this life
Don't turn your back on paradise

[III. Heretic]

Welcome tired pilgrim
Into the circle
We have been waiting

Everyone's gathered
for your arrival
All the believers

Angels fall
all for you
heretic
Demon heart
bleed for us

I've been waiting for you,
Weary preacher man
You have been expected
Now we can begin
Let this hallowed Day of Judgment reign

I have known you father
And your sacred quest
Blessed soldier fighting
You shall never rest
I have known you but do you know me?

Angels fall
all for you
heretic
Demon heart
bleed for us

(My soul is yours Dark Master, I will fight for you)

Dark Master within, I will fight for you
Dark Master of sin, now my soul is yours
Dark Master, my guide, I will die for you
Dark Master inside�

I cannot see his face
But I could feel his spite
A presence from the dead
Abandoned by the light
This shadow will consume him
from within

This power that I sense
The rage behind those eyes
Is just a shrouded ghost
A spirit sealed inside
The body and the soul both threats
For they are one

Angels fall
all for you
heretic
Demon heart
bleed for us

(My soul is yours Dark Master, I will fight for you)

Dark Master within, I will fight for you
Dark Master of sin, now my soul is yours
Dark Master, my guide, I will die for you
Dark Master inside�
Dark Master, amen, I belong to you
Dark Master within�

Heil! Heil! Heil! Heil!
Heil! Heil! Heil! Heil!

[IV. The Slaughter of The Damned]

Don't
Bother trying to find them
They will be coming to you
Fight,
Fight and destroy until you can't take anymore

Slay
Spill the blood of the rebels
They are the children of hell
Flesh,
Of the undead
Stopping at nothing to kill

Sin,
Caught in a moment of weakness
Committed the greatest of all
Sold,
Half of my soul
And now it's too late for you

I judge us
my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us

Unwelcome ones
your time has come

Lord,
You are my god and my shepherd
Nothing more shall I want
Walk,
Through the abyss
Into the shadow of death

Fear,
There is no evil to fear now
For I know you are with me
My,
Cup overflows
With my enemy's blood

I,
Decay in the house of the lord
Forever, amen
Death,
Will follow me
All the days of my life

I judge us
my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us
Unwelcome ones
your time has come

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their savior's calling
On this wicked day

Through a veil of madness
With a vicious play
One man rises up
Standing in their way

It's time for your reckoning

[V. The Reckoning ]

[Instrumental]

[VI. Salvation]

My soul grows weaker
He knows and he waits
He watches over me
Standing at the infernal gates
In the hour of darkness
The moment I feared has passed
The moment I lost my faith
Promising salvation
My soul is my own now
I do not fight for you
Dark Master

"The Root Of All Evil"

[VI. Ready]

Proud enough for you to call me arrogant
Greedy enough to be labeled a thief
Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man
Cruel enough for me to feel no grief

Never could have just a part of it
I always need more to get by
Getting right down to the heart of it
The root of all evil has been running my whole life

Dirty enough for me to lust
Leaving nothing left to trust
Jealous enough to still feel envious
Lazy enough to sleep all day
And let my life just waste away
Selfish enough to make you wait for me

Driven blindly by our sins
Misled so easily
Entirely ready to leave it behind
I'm begging to break free

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast them all away
And help to give me strength to face another day
I am ready
Help me be what I can be

[VII. Remove]

Self-centered fear has got a hold of me
Clutching my throat
Self righteous anger running all through me
Ready to explode

Procrastination paralyzing me
Wanting me dead
These obsessions that keep haunting me
Won't leave my head

Help to do for me what I can't do myself
Take this fear and pain
I can't break out this prison all alone
Help me break these chains

Humility now my only hope
Won't you take all of me
Heal this dying soul

I can feel my body breaking
I can feel my body breaking
I'm ready to let it all go
I can feel my body shaking
Right down to the foundation
The root of it all

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast it all away
And help to give me strength to face another day
I am ready
Help me what I can be
I am ready
Come to me
Take me away

"The Answer Lies Within"

Look around,
Where do you belong
Don't be afraid,
You are not the only one

Don't let the day go by,
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by in doubt,
The answer lies within

Life is short, so learn from your mistakes
And stand behind, the choices that you made
Face each day with both eyes open wide
And try to give, don't keep it all inside

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by, in doubt,
The answer lies within

You've got the future on your side
You've gonna be fine now
I know whatever you decide
You are gonna shine!!! (shinee)

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by, in doubt
You re ready to begin

Don't let a day go by in doubt
The answer lies within

"These Walls"

This is so hard for me
To find the words to say
My thoughts are standing still

Captive inside of me
All emotions start to hide
And nothing's getting through

Watch me,
Fading
I'm losing
All my instincts,
falling into darkness

Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows
I'm holding back

It's not too late for me,
To keep from sinking further
(I'm trying to find my way out,
Tear down these walls for me now)

So much uncertainty
I don't like this feeling
I'm sinking like a stone

Each time I try to speak
There's a voice I'm hearing
And it changes everything

Watch me,
Crawl from
The wreckage
Of my silence
Conversation
Failing

Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows
I'm holding back

It's not too late for me,
To keep from sinking further
(I'm trying to find my way out,
Take down these walls)

Everytime you choose to turn away
Is it worth the price you pay?
Is there someone who will wait for you
One more time? [x2]

Watch me,
Fading
I'm losing
All my instincts,
Falling into darkness

Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows
I'm holding back

It's not too late for me,
To keep from sinking further
(I'm trying to find my way out,
Tear down these walls for me now)

Tear down these walls for me
It's not too late for me
Tear down these walls for me

"I Walk Beside You"

There's a story in your eyes
I can see the hurt behind your smile
For every sign I recognize
Another one escapes me

Let me know what plagues your mind
Let me be the one to know you best
Be the one to hold you up
When you feel like you're sinking

Tell me once again
What's beneath the pain you're feeling
Don't abandon me
Or think you can't be saved

I walk beside you
Wherever you are
Whatever it takes
No matter how far
Through all that may come
And all that may go
I walk beside you
I walk beside you

Summon up your ghosts for me
Rest your tired thoughts upon my hands
Step inside this sacred place
When all your dreams seem broken

Resonate inside this temple
Let me be the one who understands
Be the one to carry you
When you can walk no further

Tell me once again
What's below the surface bleeding
If you've lost your way,
I will take you there

I walk beside you
Wherever you are
Whatever it takes
No matter how far
Through all that may come
And all that may go
I walk beside you
I walk beside you

Oh, when everything is wrong
Oh, when hopelessness surrounds you
Oh, the sun will rise again
The tide you swim against
Will carry you back home
So don't give up
Don't give in

I walk beside you
Wherever you are
Whatever it takes
No matter how far
Through all that may come
And all that may go
I walk beside you
I walk beside you

"Panic Attack"

All wound up
On the edge
Terrified

Sleep disturbed
Restless mind
Petrified

Bouts of fear
Permeate
All I see

Heightening
Nervousness
Threatens me

I am paralyzed
So afraid to die

Caught off guard
Warning signs
Never show

Tension strikes
Choking me
Worries grow

Why do I feel so numb
Is it something to do with where I come from
Should this be fight or flight
I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight

Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest
Agitated body in distress
I feel like I'm in danger
Daily life is strangled by my stress

A stifling surge
Shooting through all my veins
Extreme apprehension
Suddenly I'm insane

Lost all hope for redemption
A grave situation desperate at best

Why do I feel so numb
Is it something to do with where I come from
Should this be fight or flight
I don't know why I'm constantly reeling

Helpless hysteria
A false sense of urgency
Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety

Run
Try to hide
Overwhelmed by this complex delirium

Helpless hysteria
A false sense of urgency
Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety

Run
Try to hide
Overwhelmed by this complex delirium

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

Sacrifice my life
Neglect my kids and wife
All for you to be happy
All those sleepless nights
And countless fights to give you more
And then you say how dare that
I didn't write you back
I must be too good for you
I only care about myself

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

"Sacrificed Sons"

[Begins with samples from 9/11]

Walls are closing
Anxiously
Channel surfing
Frantically

Burning City
Smoke and fire
Planes we're certain
Faith inspired

No clues
A complete surprise
Who'll be
Coming home tonight

Heads all turning
Towards the sky
Towers crumble
Heroes die

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

Teach them what to think and feel
Your ways so enlightening
Words they preach I can't relate
If God's true Love are acts of Hate?

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

God on High
Our mistakes
Will mankind be extinct?

There's no time,
Time to waste
Who serves the truth
For Heavens' sake?

"Octavarium"

[I. Someone Like Him] [0:00 ‒ 8:47]

I never wanted to become someone like him so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that
This was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd
Never be someone like him

So many years have passed
Since I proclaimed
My independence
My mission
My aim
And my vision
So secure
Content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know
That I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm
Missing out this time

As far as I could tell
There's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself
Could this be everything
Then all I swore
That I would never be was now
So suddenly
The only thing
I wanted
To become
To be someone just like him

[II. Medicate (Awakening)] [8:48 ‒ 13:49]

A Doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep

For 30 years
Where have I been
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

Medicate me
Infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away

Medicate me
Science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can't you stop what's happening

A higher dosage he prescribes
But there's no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There's no one who's to blame
A second shot
A brief awakening

I feel the relapse
Can't break free
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

[III. Full Circle] [13:50 – 16:36]

Sailing on the seven seize the day tripper diem's ready
Jack the ripper Owens Wilson Phillips and my supper's ready
Lucy in the sky with diamond Dave's not here I come to save the
Day for nightmare cinema show me the way to get back home again

Running forward
Falling back
Spinning round and round
Looking outward
Reaching in
Scream without a sound

Leaning over
Crawling up
Stumbling all around
Losing my place
Only to find I've come full circle

Flying off the handle be careful with
That axe Eugene gene the dance machine
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba
Hey hey my my generation's home again

Running forward
Falling back
Spinning round and round
Looking outward
Reaching in
Scream without a sound

Leaning over
Crawling up
Stumbling all around
Losing my place
Only to find I've come full circle

[IV. Intervals] [16:37 – 19:53]

[Root]
Our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path

[Second]
Asking questions
Search for clues
The answer's been right in front of you

[Third]
Try to break through
Long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath

[Fourth]
Loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire

[Fifth]
Tortured Insanity
A smothering hell
Try to escape but no avail

[Sixth]
The calls of admirers
Who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more

[Seventh]
Innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madmen's impulsive designs

[Octave]
Step after step
We try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it has become too late

Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium

[V. Razor's Edge] [19:54 ‒ 24:00]

We move in circles
Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor's edge

A perfect sphere
Colliding with our fate
This story ends where it began

"As I Am"

Don't
Tell me what's in
Tell me how to write
Don't tell me how to win
This fight
Isn't your life
It isn't your right
To take the only thing that's
Mine

Proven over time
It's over your head
Don't try to read between the
Lines
Are clearly defined
Never lose sight of
Something you believe in

Takin' in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog

I've been trying to justify you
In the end I will just defy you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, Take me as I am

As I am

Still
Running uphill
Swimming against the current
I wish I weren't so
Fucked
Feels like I'm stuck
Lost in a sea of mediocrity

''Slow down,
You're thinking too much
Where is your soul?''
You cannot touch
The way I
Play
Or tell me what to say
You're in the way
Of all that I believe in

Takin' in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog
I've been wasting my breath on you
Open minds will descend upon you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, take me as I am

"This Dying Soul"

[IV. Reflections of Reality (Revisited)]

Hello, Mirror - so glad to see you my friend, it's been a while
Searching, Fearless - where do I begin to heal this wound of self-denial

Face yourself man!
Brace yourself and trace your hell back

You've been blinded, living lie a one way cold existence all the while
Now it's time to stare the problem right between the eyes you long lost child

I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking and shaking and left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making a change to fix this dying soul

Born into this world a broken home
Surrounded by love yet all alone
Forced into a life that's split in two
A mother and a father both pulling you

Then you had to deal with loss and death
Everybody thinking they know best
Coping with this shit at such an age
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage

Family disease pumped through your blood
Never had the chance you thought you could
Running all the while with no escape
Turning all that pain in to blame and hate

Living on your own by twenty one
Not a single care and having fun
Consuming all the life in front of you
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue

Possessive obsessions selfish childish games
Vengeful resentments
Passing all the blame
Living out a life of decadence
Acing without thought of consequence
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast
While spitting on the ones that matter most

Running power mad with no control
Fighting for the credit they once stole
No one can ever tell you what to do
Ruling other's lives while the can't stand the thought of you

A living reflection seen from miles away
A hopeless affliction having run astray

I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking and shaking and left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making a change to fix this dying soul

Now that you can see all you have done
It's time to take that step into the kingdom
All your sins will only make you strong
And help you break right through the prison wall

[V. Release]

Come to me my friend (Listen to me)
I'll help this torture end (Help to set me free)
Let your ego go (I can't carry this load)
You can't go through this alone (I feel so hopeless and exposed)
You'll find your peace of mind (Give me some direction)
You can no longer hide (Break out of this isolation)
Let humility (Openness, honesty)
And become what you can be (A healing tranquility)

Help me
Save me
Heal me
I can't break out of this prison all alone

These tormenting ghosts of yesterday
Will vanish when exposed
You can't hold onto your secrets
They'll only send you back alone

Your fearless admissions
Will help expel your destructive obsessions
With my help I know you can
Be at one with God and man

Hear me
Believe me
Take me
I'm ready to break right through this prison wall

Dedicated to Bill W. and all of his friends

"Endless Sacrifice"

Cold
Lying in my bed
Staring into darkness

Lost
I hear footsteps overhead
And my thoughts return
Again

Like a child who's run away
And won't be coming back
Time keeps passing by
As night turns into day

I'm so far away
And so alone
I need to see your face
To keep me sane
To make me whole

Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind
Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice

Pain
It saddens me to know
The helplessness you feel
Your light
Shines on my soul
While a thousand candles
Burn

Outside this barren room
The rain is pouring down
The emptiness inside
Is growing deeper still

You're so far away
And so alone
You long for love's embrace
To keep you sane
To make you whole

Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind

Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

Over the distance
We try to make sense
Of surviving together
While living apart

Striving for balance
We rise to the challenge
Of staying connected
In spite of circumstance

All you've forsaken
And all that you've done
So that I could live out
This undying dream

Won't be forgotten
Or taken for granted
I'll always remember
Your endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

"Honor Thy Father"

We're taught unconditional love
That blood is thicker than water
That a parent's world would revolve
Always around their son or their daughter

You pretended I was your own
And even believed that you loved me
But were always threatened by some
Invisible blood line that only you could see

You took advantage of an outreached hand
And twisted it to meet your every need
'Gimme time to re-charge my batteries,
I'll see her when she's older and I'll bounce her on my knee'

Well listen to me you ungrateful fool
Here comes a dose of reality
You'll go to your grave a sad and lonely man
The door is now closed on your pathetic little plan

On and on and on and on it goes
It's so easy to run away with nothing in tow

How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the nerve to blame this mess on me

Never in my life have I seen someone
So Ignorant to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree

I tried your four bill therapy
I tried to make amends
But nothing could lure you out of your selfish shell again
Expecting everyone to bow and kiss your feet
Don't you see respect is not a one way street
Blaming everyone for all that you've done wrong
I'll get my peace of mind when you hear this song

On and on and on and on it goes
And with every passing day true colors show

How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the balls to blame this mess on me

Never in my life have I seen someone
Oblivious to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree

Watch where you walk
Don't you dare cross the crooked step
Watch the way you talk
Don't cross the crooked step

[spoken:]
"This is a regret that you make"
"we're still connected"
"This is a regret that you make-"
"I want my family back"
"-and there's something you take"
"You can't have it. I'm sorry for you, but it's too late..."
"Mistakes like this...You don't make"
"Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you?"
"You make some...And they'll get to you"
"You don't love anybody"
"I gave you money, I gave you a car, I took you in-"
It's not OK, son"
"-but don't that mean something?"
"Do I admire people too much?"
"No...You should do better"
"That disappoints you..."
"God damn regrets!"
"You deserve to die alone for what you have done!"
GOD DAMN REGRETS!"
"Don't deny it"
"You cocksucker, I know you're here."
"Don't deny it"
"I want you to know I hate your fucking guts."
"The biggest regret in my life"
"I wish you'd fucking die."
"I've let my love go"
"I'm your blood...I'm your family"
"Is that you?"
You're not my family, not anymore"
"The fucking regrets!"
"When your own flesh and blood renounces you..."
"What did I do?"
"...you have no choice but to renounce them."
"WHAT DID I DO?"

On and on and on and on it goes
Chauvinistic, heartless, selfish, cold

How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the balls to blame this shit on me

Never in my life have I seen someone
So fucking blind to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree

"Vacant"

Hey you, Hey you
I'm right here
Conscience fading
Can't get through

Oh Lord
Helpless
Confused
Head swayed
Eyes glazed
And mine teared

She's losing control
What can I do
Her vacant eyes
Black holes
Am I losing you

"In The Name Of God"

How can this be?
Why is he the chosen one?

Saint gone astray
With a scepter and a gun

Learn to believe
In the mighty and the strong

Come bleed the beast
Follow me it won't be long

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God

Straight is the path
Leading to your salvation
Slaying the weak
Ethnic elimination

Any day we'll all be
Swept away
You'll be saved
As long as you obey

Lies
Tools of the devil inside
Written in Holy disguise
Meant to deceive and divide
Us all

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God

Blurring the lines
Between virtue and sin
They can't tell
Where God ends
And mankind begins

They know no other
Life but this
From the cradle
They are claimed

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God

Hundreds of believers
Lured into a doomsday cult
All would perish
In the name of God

Self-proclaimed messiah
Led his servants
To their death
Eighty murdered
In the name of God

Forty sons and daughters
Un-consenting plural wives
Perversions
In the name of God

Underground religion
Turning toward
The mainstream light
Blind devotion
In the name of God

Justifying violence
Citing from the Holy Book
Teaching hatred
In the name of God

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God

Religious beliefs
Fanatic obsession
Does following faith
Lead us to violence?

Unyielding crusade
Divine revelation
Does following faith
Lead us to violence?

[Chant:]
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord
he is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored
he hath loosed the fateful lightning
of his terrible swift sword
his truth is marching on.

glory, glory, hallelujah
glory, glory, hallelujah
glory, glory, hallelujah...

"The Glass Prison"

[I. REFLECTION]

Cunning, Baffling, Powerful
Been beaten to a pulp
Vigorous, Irresistable
Sick and tired and laid low
Dominating, Invincible
Black-out, loss of control
Overwhelming, Unquenchable
I'm powerless, have to let go

I can't escape it
It leaves me frail and worn
Can no longer take it
Senses tattered and torn

Hopeless surrender
Obsession's got me beat
Losing the will to live
Admitting complete defeat

Fatal Descent
Spinning around
I've gone too far
To turn back round

Desperate attempt
Stop the progression
At any length
Lift this obsession

Crawling to my glass prison
A place where no one knows
My secret lonely world begins

So much safer here
A place where I can go
To forget about my daily sins

Life here in my glass prison
A place I once called home
Fall in nocturnal bliss again

Chasing a long lost friend
I no longer can control
Just waiting for this hopelessness to end

[II. RESTORATION]

Run - fast from the wreckage of the past
A shattered glass prison wall behind me
Fight - past walking through the ashes
A distant oasis before me

Cry - desperate crawling on my knees
Begging God to please stop the insanity
Help me - I'm trying to believe
Stop wallowing in my own self pity

"We've been waiting for you my friend
The writing's been on the wall
All it takes is a little faith
You know you're the same as us all"

Help me - I can't break out this prison all alone
Save me - I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own
Heal me - I can't restore my sanity alone

Enter the door
Desperate
Fighting no more
Help me restore
To my sanity
At this temple of hope

I need to learn
Teach me how
Sorrow to burn
Help me return
To humanity
I'll be fearless and thorough
To enter this temple of hope

Believe
Transcend the pain
Living the life
Humility
Opened my eyes
This new odyssey
Of rigorous honesty

Serenity
I never knew
Soundness of mind
Helped me to find
Courage to change
All the things that I can

"We'll help you perform this miracle
But you must set your past free
You dug the hole, but you can't bury your sole
Open your mind and you'll see"

Help me - I can't break out this prison all alone
Save me - I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own
Heal me - I can't restore my sanity alone

[III. REVELATION]

Way off in the distance I saw a door
I tried to open
I tried forcing with all of my will and still
The door wouldn't open
[replaced with "but" in this line]

Unable to trust in my faith
I turned and walked away
I looked around, felt a chill in the air
Took my will and turned it over

The glass prison which once held me is now gone
["now" is not heard in this line]
A long lost fortress
Armed only with liberty
And the key of my willingness

Fell down on my knees and prayed
"Thy will be done"
I turned around, saw a light shining through
The door was wide open

"Blind Faith"

Hear me, speaking
Asking why I even bother
Tell me, how you
Live from day to day

Take your time and look around
Is this utopia you've found

Sick of all of this
The suffering and we just carry on
Isn't it time we care and lose the hate
Understand our fears

But we do all that we can
Justify the means to an end
Sorry you must excuse me
I've painted my own Mona Lisa
She's fixed everything
Now I'm spoiled beyond my wildest dreams

Blind Faith we have in you
Invisible
Which direction do we choose
Predictable

Take the streets, the beaten path
Our system works for whom I ask
Yeah I have it all
The bigger house
An iron fence to keep you out

When did we all let you down
So come Messiah show us how how
Our human spirit drowns
Don't think you hear me now
No sign of you around
What is it you hope to see

Blind Faith we have in you
Invisible
Which direction do we choose
Predictable
Give us something we can use
Desirable
Cause you've done all you can do
Regrettable

And still life pushes on
With or without you
We've got to carry on
Our will, will guide us to
A place where we belong
Know there lies the truth
I am the believer who gives purpose on to you

I don't think we let you down
So come Messiah show us how how
Throw us a pure lifeline
I hope that you hear me
Too proud to be around
There's more to us than we see now

Blind Faith we have in you
Invisible
Which direction do we choose
Predictable
Self ignorance, abuse
Desirable
Cause you've done all you can do
Incredible

"Misunderstood"

Waiting
In the calm of desolation
Wanting to break
From this circle of confusion

Sleeping
In the depths of isolation
Trying to wake
From this daydream of illusion

How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me
How can I know so many
Never really knowing anyone

If I seem superhuman
I have been
Misunderstood

It challenges the essence of my soul
And leaves me in a state of disconnection
As I navigate the maze of self control

Playing a lion being led to a cage
I turn from a thief to a beggar
From a god to God save me

How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me
How can I know so many
Never really knowing anyone

If I seem superhuman
I have been
Misunderstood

Playing a lion being led to a cage
I turn from surreal to seclusion
From love to disdain
From belief to delusion
From a thief to a beggar
From a god to God save me

How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me
How can I know so many
Never really knowing anyone

If I seem superhuman
I have been
Misunderstood

"The Great Debate"

[also known as "Conflict At Ground Zero"]
[music by Myung, Petrucci, Portnoy, Rudess]
[lyrics by John Petrucci]

"A gallop snapshot poll taken immediately after President Bush's speach on
funding embryonic stem cell research last night shows that half of Americans
approve of his decision, 25% do not, and still another 25% are not sure what
to think."

"Most people don't even know what stem cells are."

"Who is going to scream the loudest? Will it be the right-to-lifers or will
it be the scientists? And now what is going to happen is there will be a
tremendous amount of lobbying in Washington, D.C.: scientists,
entertainers, people who want to see this research - will be coming forth."

"I am concerned about it. Christopher Reeves is concerned about it.
Everyone is concerned about it. The big question is do the ends justify
the means? When we talk about research, yes, we can cure a lot of things...
speculatively. But, where is the proof?"

"These developing human beings that you are talking about, these embryos,
were produced in an artificial, scientific environment. In vitro
fertilization is not God's will."

"That doesn't make them any less human, though, after that happens."

"We are on a road where we really don't know where we are going as far as
what's next. We are talking about harvesting embryos. We are talking about
this, we are talking about that, but what is the cost?"

"How could we possibly abandon the research?"

"That is right. That is the old question? If you think the research is good
then you may not have a problem with it. It is only if you think the
research is questionable that you get defensive about it. (You do have time
to research these embryos later if we choose to do so. While people are
suffering, we are not truly certain that this will provide a cure.)"

"And there was a great outrage in the conservative churches... You cannot
use developing humans... At that point in time they turn into humans."

"I feel that abandoning this research could be a mistake. Researching this
may allow us to save other lives or at least to improve the quality of
lives."

"We do not have the answers, yet. We need to put the money where we will get
those answers in the future. Listen, we are out of time."

What if someone said
Promise lies ahead
Hopes are high in certain scientific circles
Life won't have to end
You could walk again

What if someone said
Problems lie ahead
They've uncovered something highly controversial
The right to life is strong
Can't you see it's wrong

Humankind has reached a turning point
Poised for conflict at ground zero
Ready for a war
Do we look to our unearthly guide
Or to white coat heroes
Searching for a cure

Turn to the light
Don't be frightened of the shadows it creates
Turn to the light
Turning away would be a terrible mistake

Anarchistic moral vision
Industries of death
Facing violent opposition
Unmolested breathe

Ethic inquisitions breed
Antagonistic views
Right wing sound bite premonitions
In a labyrinth of rules

Are you justified
Are you justified
Are you justified
Justified in taking
Life to save life
Life to save life
Taking life to save life

This embryonic clay
Wrapped in fierce debate
Would be thrown away
Or otherwise discarded

Some of us believe
It may hold the key
To treatment of disease
And secrets highly guarded

Are you justified
Are you justified
Are you justified
Justified in taking
Life to save life
Life to save life
Life to save life

Human kind has reached a turning point
Poised for conflict at ground zero
Ready for a war
Do we look to our unearthly guide
Or to white coat heroes
Searching for a cure

Turn to the light
Don't be frightened of the shadows it creates
Turn to the light
Turning away would be a terrible mistake

We're reaching
But have we gone too far

Harvesting existence
Only to destroy
Carelessly together
We are sliding

Someone else's future
Four days frozen still
Someone else's fate
We are deciding

Miracle potential
Sanctity of life
Faced against each other
We're divided

Should we push the boundaries
Or should we condemn
Moral guilt and science
Have collided

Turn to the light
We defy our own mortality these days
Turn to the light
Pay attention to the questions we have raised

"One of the big questions that still remains for me, though, is that all of
these embryos that are sent or will be discarded - is this worse than just
throwing those away?"

"You do not know that all of these will be discarded. All of a sudden you
say which ones will be discarded. And all of sudden you have people being
solicited for parts of their anatomy. Then they harvest parts of people's
bodies. That is how it starts."

"People are not soliciting; there are fertility clinics that have extra
embryos."

"The research is a scientific advancement. I know we are going down a road
that we may not know where we end, but that is exactly what science is all
about. I am very sorry, but I do feel sympathy for those whose spines have
been severed... There is a possibility that we might cure them. I am
concerned about a cure for juvenile diabetes and if these types of
scientific advancement can cure these diseases, then quite candidly I think
there ought to be at least what President Bush has proposed: some limited
research."

"Stem cells come from developing human beings and they should not be
experimented on that doesn't make sense or that is unethical, but at the
same time there is great promise."

"I have a 28-year old son who is paraplegic. And if there is a small
chance that my son can be able to have feeling and be able to walk then I am
all for it."

"Human beings have been evolving for 10's of thousands of years and we are
just injecting cells from embryos into people's brains. How do we come to
do something like that?"

<|endoftext|>

"Disappear"

Why, tell me the reasons why
Try, still I don't understand
Will I ever feel this again
Blue sky, I'll meet you in the end
Free them, free the memories of you
Free me, and rest 'til I'm with you

A day like today
My whole world has been changed
Nothing you say
Will help ease my pain

Turn, I'll turn this slowly round
Burn, burn to feel alive again
She, she'd want me to move on
See me, this place I still belong
Give chase, to find more than I have found
And face, this time now on my own

Days disappear
And my world keeps changing
I feel you here
And it keeps me sane

So I'm moving on
I'll never forget
As you lay there and watched me
Accepting the end
I knew you were scared
You were strong I was trying
I gave you my hand
I said it's okay letting go time to leave here
And I'll carry on
The best that I can without you here beside me
Let him come take you home

"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence"

[I. OVERTURE]

[instrumental]

[II. ABOUT TO CRASH]

She can't stop pacing
She never felt so alive
Her thoughts are racing
Set on overdrive

It takes a village
This she knows is true
they're expecting her
And she's got work to do

He helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes
He says I've never seen her get this bad

Even though she seems so high
He knows that she can't fly
and when she falls out of the sky
He'll be standing by

She was raised in a small midwestern town
By a charming and eccentric loving father
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl
And everyone thought highly of her

And she tried everyday
With endless drive
To make the grade
Then one day
She woke up to find
The perfect girl
Had lost her mind

Once barely taking a break
Now she sleeps the days away
She helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
All she wants to do is cry
No one ever knew she was so sad

Cause even though she gets so high
And thinks that she can fly
She will fall out of the sky
But in the face of misery
She found hopefulness
Feeling better
She had weathered
This depression

Much to her advantage
She resumed her frantic pace
Boundless power
Midnight hour
She enjoyed the race

[III. WAR INSIDE MY HEAD]

Napalm showers
Showed the cowards
We weren't there to mess around

Through heat exhaustion
And mind distortion
A military victory mounted on innocent ground

Hearing voices from miles away
Saying things never said
Seeing shadows in the light of the day
Waging a war inside my head

Years and years of
Bloodshed and warfare
Our mission was only to get in and kill

A free vacation
Of palmtrees and shrapnel
Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell

Hearing voices from miles away
Saying things never said
Seeing shadows in the light of the day
Waging a war inside my head

Feeling strangers staring my way
Reading minds never read
Tasting danger with each word I say
Waging a war inside my head

[IV. THE TEST THAT STUMPED THEM ALL]

Standing in the darkness
Waiting for the light
The smell of pure adrenaline
Burning in the night

Random blinding flashes
Aiming at the stage
Intro tape begins to roll
Igniting sonic rage

Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all

"The boy is simply crazy
Suffering from delusions
We honestly think that maybe
He might need an institution

He lives in a world of fiction
And really could use some help
We have just the place to fix him
To save him from himself"

Curled up in the darkness
Searching for the light
The smell of stale sweat and shit
Streaming through the night

Random urine testing
Pills red, pink and blue
Counseling and therapy
Providing not a clue

Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all

"We can't seem to find the answers
He seemed such a clear cut case
We cannot just let him leave here
And put all this work to waste

Why don't we try shock treatment
It really might do some help
We have just the tools to fix him
To save him from himself"

[V. GOODNIGHT KISS]

Goodnight kiss in your nightgown
Lavender in your bed
So innocent as you lie down
Sweet dreams that run through your head

Are you lonely without Mommy's love?
I want you to know I'd die for that moment
You're just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all

It's been 5 years to the day and
My tainted blood's still the same
I can't help acting this way and
Those bastard doctors are gonna pay

I'm so lonely without baby's love
I want you to know I'd die for one more moment
I'm just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all

[VI. SOLITARY SHELL]

He seemed no different from the rest
Just a healthy normal boy
His mama always did her best
And he was daddy's pride and joy

He learned to walk and talk on time
But never cared much to be held
and steadily he would decline
Into his solitary shell

As a boy he was considered somewhat odd
Kept to himself most of the time
He would daydream in and out of his own world
but in every other way he was fine

He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell

A temporary catatonic
Madman on occasion
When will he break out
Of his solitary shell

He struggled to get through his day
He was helplessly behind
He poured himself onto the page
Writing for hours at a time

As a man he was a danger to himself
Fearful and sad most of the time
He was drifting in and out of sanity
But in every other way he was fine

He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell

A momentary maniac
With casual delusions
When will he be let out
Of his solitary shell

[VII. ABOUT TO CRASH (REPRISE)]

I'm alive again
The darkness far behind me
I'm invincible
Despair will never find me

I feel strong
I've got a new sense of elation
Boundless energy
Euphoria fixation

Still it's hard to just get by
It seems so meaningless to try
When all I want to do is cry
Who would ever know I felt so sad

Even though I get so high
I know that I will never fly
And when I fall out of the sky
Who'll be standing by

Will you be standing by

[VIII. LOSING TIME/GRAND FINALE]

She dresses in black everyday
She keeps her hair simple and plain
She never wears makeup
But no one would care if she did anyway

She doesn't recall yesterday
Faces seem twisted and strange
But she always wakes up
Only to find she'd been miles away

Absence of awareness
Losing time
A lapse of perception
Losing time

Wanting to escape
She had created a way to survive
She learned to detach from herself
A behavior that kept her alive

Hope in the face of our human distress
Helps us to understand the turbulence deep inside
That takes hold of our lives
Shame and disgrace over mental unrest
Keeps us from saving those we love
The grace within our hearts
And the sorrow in our souls
Deception of fame
Vengeance of war
Lives torn apart
Losing oneself
Spiraling down
Feeling the walls closing in
A journey to find
The answers inside
Our illusive mind

"Scene One: Regression"

[H:]
"Close your eyes and begin to relax. Take a deep breath, and let it out
slowly. Concentrate on your breathing. With each breath you become more
relaxed. Imagine a brilliant white light above you, focusing on this light as
it flows through your body. Allow yourself to drift off as you fall deeper and
deeper into a more relaxed state of mind. Now as I count backward from ten to
one, you will fill more peaceful, and calm. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. You
will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you. Five. Four. Three. Two. If
at any time you need to come back, all you must do is open your eyes. One."

[N:]
Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My subconscious mind
Starts spinning through time
To rejoin the past once again

Nothing seems real
I`m starting to feel
Lost in the haze of a dream

And as I draw near
The scene becomes clear
Like watching my life on a screen

Hello Victoria so glad to see you
My friend

"II. Strange Deja Vu"

[N:]
Subconscious strange sensation
Unconscious relaxation
What a pleasant nightmare
And I can`t wait to get there again

Every time I close my eyes
There`s another vivid surprise
Another whole life waiting
Chapters unfinished, fading

Closer now - Slowly coming into view
I`ve arrived - Blinding sunshine beaming through

There`s a house I`m drawn into
Familiar settings, nothing new
There`s a pathway leading there
With a haunting chill in the air

There`s a room at the top of the stairs
Every night I`m drawn up there
There`s a girl in the mirror
Her face is getting clearer
Young child won`t you tell me why I`m here?

In her eyes - I sense a story never told
Behind the disguise - There`s something tearing
At her soul

[V:]
Tonight I`ve been searching for it
A feeling that`s deep inside me
Tonight I`ve been searching for
The one that nobody knows
Trying to break free

I just can`t help myself
I`m feeling like I`m going out of my head
Tears my heart into two
I`m not the one the sleeper thought he knew

[N:]
Back on my feet again
Eyes open to real world
Metropolis surrounds me
The mirror`s shattered the girl

Why is this other life
Haunting me everyday
I`d break through the other side
If only I`d find the way

Something`s awfully familiar
The feeling`s so hard to shake
Could I have lived in that other world
It`s a link that I`m destined to make

I`m still searching but I don`t know what for
The missing key to unlock my mind`s door

Today I am searching for it
A feeling that won`t go away
Today I am searching for it
The one that I only know
Trying to break free

I just can`t help myself
I`m feeling like I`m going out of my head
Tears my soul into two
I`m not the one I thought I always knew

I just can`t help myself
I`m feeling like I`m going out of my head
Uncanny, strange Deja Vu
But I don`t mind - I hope to find the truth

"Scene Three: I. Through My Words"

[N:]
All your eyes have ever seen
All you`ve ever heard
Is etched upon my memory
I spoken through my words

All that I take with me
Is all you`ve left behind
We`re sharing one eternity
Living in two minds
Linked by an endless thread
Impossible to break

<|endoftext|>

"II. Fatal Tragedy"

[N:]
Alone at night
I feel so strange
I need to find
All the answers to my dreams

When I sleep at night
I hear the cries
What does this mean?

I shut the door and traveled to another home
I met an older man, he seemed to be alone
I felt that I could trust him
He talked to me that night;

"Lad did you know a girl was murdered here?"
"This fatal tragedy was talked about for years"
Victoria`s gone forever
Only memories remain
She passed away
She was so young

Without love
Without truth
There can be no turning back

Without faith
Without hope
There can be no peace of mind

As the night went on
I started to find my way
I learned about a tragedy
A mystery still today

I tried to get more answers
But he said, "You`re on your own"
Then he turned away and left me
As I stand there all alone
He said, "You`ll know the truth
As your future days unfold"

Without love
Without truth
There can be no turning back

Without faith
Without hope
There can be no peace of mind

"Scene Four: Beyond This Life"

[Headline:] "Murder, young girl killed
Desperate shooting at Echoe`s hill
Dreadful ending, killer died
Evidently suicide"

A witness heard a horrifying sound
He ran to find a woman dead and
Lying on the ground

Standing by her was a man
Nervous, shaking, gun in hand
Witness says he tried to help
But he`d turned the weapon on himself

His body fell across that poor young girl
After shouting out in vain
The witness ran to call for assistance
A sad close to a broken love affair

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

She wanted love forever
But he had another plan
He fell into an evil way
She had to let him down
She said "I can`t love a wayward man"

She may have found a reason to forgive
If he had only tried to change
Was their fatal meeting prearranged?

Had a violent struggle taken place?
There was every sign that lead there
Witness found a switchblade on the ground
Was the victim unaware?
They continued to investigate
They found a note in the killer`s pocket
It could have been a suicide letter
Maybe he had lost her love

I feel there`s only one thing left to do
I'd sooner take my life away than live with losing you

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

All that we learn this time
(What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life

<|endoftext|>

"Scene Five: Through Her Eyes"

[N:]
She never really had a chance
On that fateful moonlight night
Sacrificed without a fight
A victim of her circumstance

Now that I've become aware
And I've exposed this tragedy
A sadness grows inside of me
It all seems so unfair

I'm learning all about my life
By looking through her eyes

Just beyond the churchyard gates
Where the grass is overgrown
I saw the writing on her stone
I felt like I would suffocate

In loving memory of our child
So innocent, eyes open wide
I felt so empty as I cried
Like part of me had died

And as her image
Wandered through my head
I wept just like a baby

As I lay awake in bed

And I know what it's like
To lose someone you love
And this felt just the same

She wasn't given any choice
Desperation stole her voice
I've been given so much more in life
I've got a son, I've got a wife

I had to suffer one last time
To grieve for her and say goodbye
Relive the anguish of my past
To find out who I was at last

The door has opened wide
I'm turning with the tide
Looking through her eyes

"Scene Six: Home"

[The Sleeper:]
Shine-lake of fire
Lights take me higher
My mind drips desire
Confined and overtired

Living this charade
Is getting me nowhere
I can't shake this charade
The city's cold blood calls me home
Home it's what I long for
Back home where I belong

The city - it calls to me
Decadent scenes from my memory
Sorrow - eternity
My demons are coming to drown me

Help - I'm falling, I'm crawling
I can't keep away from its clutch
Can't have it, this habit
It's calling me back to my home

[The Miracle:]
I remember the first time she came to me
Poured out her soul all night and cried

I remember I was told there's a new love that's born
For each one that has died

I never thought that I
Could carry on with this life
But I can't resist myself
No matter how hard I try

Living their other life
Is getting them nowhere
I'll make her my wife
Her sweet temptations calls me home
Home it's what I long for
My home where she belongs

Her ecstasy - means so much to me
Even deceiving my own blood
Victoria watches and thoughtfully smiles
She's taking me to my home

Help - he's my brother, but I love her
I can't keep away from her touch
Deception, dishonor
It's calling me back to my home

[Nicholas:]
Her story - it holds the key
Unlocking dreams from my memory
Solving this mystery
Is everything that is a part of me

Help - regression, obsession
I can't keep away from her touch
Leave no doubt, to find out
It's calling me back to my home

"II. One Last Time"

[N:]
It doesn`t make any sense
This tragic ending
In spite of the evidence
There`s something still missing

Heard some of the rumours told
A taste of one`s wealth
Did Victoria wound his soul?
Did she bid him farewell?

One last time
We`ll lay down today
One last time
Until we fade away
One last time
We`ll lay down today
One last time
We slowly fade away

[N:]
Here I am inside his home
It holds the many clues
To my suspicions
And as I`m standing here right now
I`m finally shown what I have always known

Coincidence I can`t believe
As my childhood dreams slowly come true

Are these her memories
Awakened through my eyes
This house has brought back to life

An open door
I walk on through
Into his bedroom

Feeling as cold as outside
The walls disappear
To some woman who`s screaming
A man pleads forgiveness
His words I cannot hear

"Scene Eight: The Spirit Carries On"

[N:]
Where did we come from?
Why are we here?
Where do we go when we die?
What lies beyond
And what lay before?
Is anything certain in life?

They say " Life is too short"
"The here and the now"
And " You`re only given one shot"
But could there be more
Have I lived before
Or could this be all that we`ve got?

If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

I used to be frightened of dying
I used to think death was the end
But that was before
I`m not scared anymore
I know that my soul will transcend

I may never find all the answers
I may never understand why
I may never prove
What I know to be true
But I know that I still have to try

If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

[V:]
"Move on, be brave
Don`t weep at my grave
Because I`m no longer here
But please never let
Your memories of me disappear"

[N:]
Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My questioning mind
Has help me to find
The meaning in my life again
Victoria`s real
I finally feel
At peace with the girl in my dreams
And now that I`m here
It`s perfectly clear
I found out what all of this means

If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

"Scene Nine: Finally Free"

[Hypnotist:]
You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light.
Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime.
As the light dissipates you will slowly fade back into
consciousness, remembering all you have learned.
When I tell you to open your eyes you will return to the present,
Feeling peaceful and refresh.
Open your eyes Nicholas.

[Miracle:]
Friday evening
The blood still on my hands
To think that she would leave me now
For that ungrateful man
Sole survivor
No witness to the crime
I must act fast to cover up
I think that there`s still time
He`d seem hopeless and lost with this note
They`ll buy into the words that I wrote
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my love
I`ve finally broke free
No longer
Torn in two
I`d take my own life before losing you

[Victoria:]
Feeling good this Friday afternoon
I ran into Julian
Said we'd get together soon
He`s always had my heart
He needs to know
I`ll break free of the Miracle
It`s time for him to go
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my love
I`ve finally broke free
No longer
Torn in two
He`d kill his brother if he only knew
Their love renewed
They`d rendezvous
In a pathway out of view
They thought no one knew
Then came a shot out of the night
"Open your eyes, Victoria"

[Sleeper:]
One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
Until we fade away
One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
We fade away
As their bodies lie still
And the ending draws near
Spirits rise through the air
All their fears disappear
It all becomes clear
A blinding light comes into view
An old soul exchanged for a new
Familiar voice comes shining through

[Nicholas:]
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my life
I`m finally free
No longer
Torn in two
I learned about my life by living through you
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my life
I`ve finally free
No longer
Torn in two
Living my own life by learning from you
We`ll meet again my friend
Someday soon

"New Millennium"

A single star behind me
A red sky burns ahead
A lonely light below me
Awake among the dead
An overwhelming feeling
Leaves me numband strange
A sense of new beginning
I sense a wind of change

Out with the old useless
People so cold ruthless welcome
In a new millennium
How many times must I
Live out this nightmare I
Can't wait until a new millennium

I've got this feeling
The tide is turning now baby
Funny feeling everything's gonna be alright now

Living out a constant deja vu
Keep your head up
Please be patient we will get to you
Keep your head up
Just have some faith and you can see it
Through
Keep your head up
But faith don't pay the rent that's overdue
Keep your head up
All that's glittering is turning blue
Keep your head up
What they want from me ain't gotta clue
Keep your head up
Swallow pride before it swallows you
Keep your head up
Don't dare bite the hand that's starving you
Keep your head up

How can you keep your head
And not go insane when the only light at the end
Of the tunnel is another train

The lies ten feet tall
Have broken my fall
Welcome you all new millennium

It's well overdue and I can't wait to
Welcome in a new millennium
I've got this feeling
The tide is turning now baby
Funny feeling
Everything's gonna be alright now

"You Not Me"

Being round you is driving me crazy
Watching you run is making me lazy
You're trying to buy a place in my head
Telling me lines I've already read
Speaking my name to try to confuse me
Say it again you're starting to lose me

That's alright I'm okay
It happens every single day
It's all the same
But I'm not blind

It's all about you not me
It's all about the things
That you're expecting me to be
There's not enough time to live
And all that you're expecting me to give

It's all about you not me
It's all about you not me

You're building my prison brick by brick
Eating your words is making me sick
You get what you want
Cause nothing is sacred
You're reading my mind
And leaving me naked
You say I gotta give before I receive it
One of these days I'll believe it.

It's all about you not me
It's all about the things
That you're expecting me to be
There's not enough time to live
And all that you're expecting me to give

It's all about you not me
It's all about you not me

Wait, I hear it again
Don't turn on the lights until we
Hear the way it ends

The story unfolds in her eyes
Where midnight hysteria's
No big surprise
Battered and bruised
Always confusing
The love that she's losing for hate

Hey, I hope you know
I'm taking all of this time with me when I go
Shame, you're not to blame

Terror by night
Liar by day
Telling her secrets
Won't take them away

"Hollow Years"

He's just the kind of man
You hear about
Who leaves his family
For an easy out
They never saw the signs
He never said a word
He couldn't take another day

Carry me to the shoreline
Bury me in the sand
Walk me across the water
And maybe you'll understand

Once the stone
You're crawling under
Is lifted off your shoulders
Once the cloud that's raining
Over you head disappears
The noise that you'll hear
Is the crashing down of hollow years

She's not the kind of girl
You hear about
She'll never want another
She'll never be without
She'll give you all the signs
She'll tell you everything
Then turn around and walk away

Carry me to the shoreline
Bury me in the sand
Walk me across the water
And maybe you'll understand

Once the stone
You're crawling under
Is lifted off your shoulders
Once the cloud that's raining
Over you head disappears
The noise that you'll hear
Is the crashing down of hollow years

Carry me to the shoreline
Bury me in the sand
Walk me across the water
And maybe you'll understand

Once the stone
You're crawling under
Is lifted off your shoulders
Once the cloud that's raining
Over you head disappears
The noise that you'll hear
Is the crashing down of hollow years

"Burning My Soul"

A thorn in my side, a chip on my shoulder
A lump in my throat, the size of a boulder
The chill up my spine, can't get any colder
And you wonder why I can't smile

A knot in my gut, an ape on my back
In the heat of the moment, I'm knocked off the track
You drop the ball, I pick up the slack
And you ask me why my hairs gray

Twisting, turning
Losing all sense of yearning
Living and learning
The pressure keeps on burning my soul

I say it's green and then you tell me it's red
Keep your thoughts and ideas
Locked inside of your head
We've got someone
Who can think for you instead
And he sounds just like the last one

Twisting, turning
Losing all sense of yearning
Living and learning
The pressure keeps on burning my soul

Responsible thinkers
Throw caution to the wind
But I find myself
Speaking from within
I can't live my life
Walking on eggshells
To stay on your good side

Using your words
Controlling my life
Can't you see it's my words
That gives you your life
So I hurt your feelings
Well I'm really sorry
But I don't give a shit...

Twisting, turning
Losing all sense of yearning
Living and learning
The pressure keeps on burning my soul

"Lines In The Sand"

Sometimes, for a moment of bliss
And the passion, we're craving
There's a message we miss
Sometimes when the spirits left alone
We must believe in something
To find if we've grown

Tragic reflex, shattered calm
Static progress, senses gone
Numb awareness, final psalm

Swept away with the tide
Through the holes in my hands
Crown of thorns
At my side drawing lines in the sand

Sometimes, if you're perfectly still
You can hear the virgin weeping
For the savior of your will
Sometimes, your castles in the air
And the fantasies you're seeking

Are the crosses you bear

Sacred conflict, blessed prize
Weeping crosses, stainless eyes
Desperate addict, faith disguised

Swept away with the tide
Through the holes in my hands
Crown of thorns
At my side drawing lines in the sand

We fabricate our demons
Invite them into our homes
Have supper with the aliens
And fight the war alone
We conjure up our skeletons
Enlist the den of thieves
Frightened from our closets
Then sewn upon our sleeves

In the stream of consciousness
There is a river crying
Living comes much easier

Once we admit
We're dying

Sometimes, in the wreckage of our wake
There's a bitterness we harbor
And hate for hatred's sake
Sometime we dig an early grave
And crucify our instincts
For the hope we couldn't save

Sometimes a view from sinless eyes
Centers our perspective
And pacifies our cries
Sometimes the anguish we survive
And the mysteries we nurture
Are the fabrics of our lives

Swept away with the tide
Through the holes in my hands
Crown of thorns
At my side drawing lines in the sand

"Take Away My Pain"

I was sitting on the edge of his bed
Staring at the headlines on the paper
He said, "look at poor gene Kelly
I guess he won't be singing in the rain."
You can take away my heroes
Can you take away my pain

Take away my pain
Leave the cold outside
Please don't let it rain
Don't stumble on my pride
Take away my pain
I'm not frightened any more
Just stay with me tonight
I'm tired of this fight
Soon I'll be knocking at your door

She was standing by the edge of his bed
Staring at the message on their faces
He said, "what else can you do babe?
I guess I won't be coming home again."
They just took away all my promises
Make them take away my pain

Take away my pain
Leave the cold outside
Please don't let it rain
Don't stumble on my pride
Take away my pain
I'm not frightened any more
Just stay with me tonight
I'm tired of this fight
Soon I'll be knocking at your door

His final scene
The actor bows
And all those years
Are gone somehow
The crowd applauds
The curtain falls

I was standing by the edge of the water
I noticed my reflection in the waves
Then I saw you looking back at me
And I knew that for a moment
You were calling out my name
You took away my hero
Will you take away my pain

Take away my pain
Let the cold inside
It's time to let it rain
There's nothing left to hide
Take away my pain
I'm not frightened any more
I'm learning to survive
Without you in my life
Til you come knocking at my door.......

"Just Let Me Breathe"

Open your eyes
And turn off your mind
Step right up folks and you will find
Agrowing trend
An epidemic
Spread with zen
And hypodermics

Just close your mind
You can find all you need with your eyes

The big machines take care of
You until you kill yourself
And then the sales go through the roof
Calculated, formulated
Feed my head with simple thoughts
And let me breathe instead of being taught
All bottled up and tearing at the seams
I'm bored
Just let me breathe

A daily dose of eMpTyV
Will flush your mind right down the drain
Shannon Hoon and Kurt Cobain,
Make yourself a household name

Just close your mind
You can find all you need with your eyes

The big machines take care of you
Until you kill yourself
And then the sales go through the roof
Calculated, formulated
Feed my head with simple thoughts
And let me breathe instead of being taught
All bottled up and tearing at the seams
I'm bored
Just let me breathe

Strike up your best angst ridden posture
Manufactured anger
Let's not forget my legacy
All my heroes have failed me
Now they're dead and buried

Just close your mind
You can find all you need with your eyes

The big machines will take care of you
Until the fashion fades
And the checks go through
My bank roll's red and my face is blue
And still they'll turn their backs on you for
Someone new

Feed my head
With some real thoughts
And let me think instead
Of being taught
I'll say things
You won't believe
Just stand back
Just let me breathe.......

"Anna Lee"

Helpless child
They invite your hands to fill their needs
Will you be the same
Shameless smile
To steal from you the innocence that bleeds
Will they feel your pain

Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone

She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't wanna be alone where do you belong
Anna lee

Behind those eyes
The vivid scene
A lucid dream within
Questioned secrets are revealed
And everytime
You can't deny
The lines that trace your skin
Wounds that never heal

Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone

She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't wanna be alone where do you belong
Anna Lee

And now she's calling out a name
Can't keep on hiding all her pain
You feel the rain move in
As you begin
To turn and answer the call

Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone

She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't wanna be alone where do you belong

"Trial Of Tears"

[I. IT'S RAINING]

Under the sun, there is nothing to hide
Under the moon, the stranger waits inside
People disappear
The music fades away
Splashing through the rain
I'll dream with them one day
It's raining, raining,
On the streets of New York city
It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven

I may have wasted all those years
They're not worth their time in tears
I may have spent too long in darkness
In the warmth of my fears

Take a look at yourself
Not at anyone else
And tell me what you see
I know the air is cold
I know the streets are cruel
But I'll enjoy the ride today

It's raining, raining,
On the streets of New York city
It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven

I may have wasted all those years
They're not worth their time in tears
I may have spent too long in darkness
In the warmth of my fears

As I walk through all my myths
Rising and sinking like the waves
With my thoughts wrapped around me
Through a trial of tears

Hidden by disguise, stumbling in a world
Feeling uninspired, he gets into his car
Not within his eyes to see, open up, open up
Not much better than the man you hate

[II. DEEP IN HEAVEN]

[Instrumental]

[III. THE WASTELAND]

Still awake
I continue to move along
Cultivating my own nonsense
Welcome to the wasteland
Where you'll find ashes, nothing but ashes
Still awake
Bringing change, bringing movement,
Bringing life
A silent prayer thrown away,
Disappearing in the air
Rising, sinking, raining deep inside me
Nowhere to turn,
I look for a way back home
It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven

"A Change Of Seasons"

[I. The Crimson Sunrise]

[Instrumental]

[II. Innocence]

I remember a time
My frail, virgin mind
Watched the crimson sunrise
Imagined what it might find
Life was filled with wonder
I felt the warm wind blow
I must explore the boundaries
Transcend the depth of winter's snow

Innocence caressing me
I never felt so young before
There was so much life in me
Still I longed to search for more

But those days are gone now
Changed like a leaf on a tree
Blown away forever
Into the cool autumn breeze
The snow has now fallen
And my sun's not so bright
I struggle to hold on
With the last of my might

In my den of inequity
Viciousness and subtlety
Struggle to ease the pain
Struggle to find the same

Ignorance surrounding me
I've never been so filled with fear
All my life's been drained from me
The end is drawing near...

[III. Carpe Diem]

"Carpe diem
Seize the day"

I'll always remember
The chill of November
The news of the fall
The sounds in the hall
The clock on the wall
Ticking away
"Seize the Day"
I heard him say
Life will not always be this way
Look around
Hear the sounds
Cherish your life
While you're still around

("Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
(Old Time is still a-flying;)
(And this same flower that smiles today)
(Tomorrow will be dying")

We can learn
From the past
But those days
Are gone
We can hope
For the future
But there might not be one

The words stuck in my mind
Alive from what I've learned
I have to seize the day
To home I returned

Preparing for her flight
I held with all my might
Fearing my deepest fright
She walked into the night
She turned for one last look
She looked me in the eye
I said, "I Love You...
Good-bye"

("It's the most awful thing you'll ever hear")
("If you're lying to me...")
("Oh, you dearly love her")
("...just have to leave...)
(All our lives")
("Seize the day!")
("Something happened")
("Gather ye rosebuds while ye may")
("She was killed")

[IV. The Darkest Of Winters]

[Instrumental]

[V. Another World]

So far or so it seems
All is lost
With nothing fulfilled
Off the pages and the
T.V. screen
Another world
Where nothing's true

Tripping through
The life fantastic
Lose a step
And never get up
Left alone
With a cold blank stare
I feel like giving up

I was blinded by a paradise
Utopia high in the sky
A dream that only drowned me
Deep in sorrow, wondering why

Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what
Don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Then string him up for all the world to see

I'm sick of all
Your hypocrites
Holding me at bay
And I don't need
Your sympathy
To get me through the day

Seasons change and so can I
Hold on Boy
No time to cry
Untie these strings
I'm climbing down
I won't let them push me away

Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what
Don't let him be
Let's feed upon
His misery
Now it's time for them
To deal with me

[VI. The Inevitable Summer]

[Instrumental]

[VII. The Crimson Sunset]

I'm much wiser now
A lifetime of memories
Run through my head
They taught me how
For better or worse
Alive or dead
I realize
There's no turning back
Life goes on
The offbeaten track

I sit down with my son
Set to see the Crimson Sunset
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
Many years have come and gone
I've lived my life, but now must move on
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
He's my only one
Now that my time has come
Now that my life is done
We look into the sun
"Seize the day
And don't you cry
Now it's time
To say good-bye
Even though
I'll be gone
I will live on
Live on"

"Funeral For A Friend / Love Lies Bleeding"

The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house
Is gonna grow and die

Oh it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said I'm sorry honey
If I don't change the pace
I can't face another day

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through

You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
While if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

Oooooh oooh
Oooooh
Oh oh oh oh ooh
Love lies bleeding in my hands
Oooh
Oooh ooh

"Perfect Strangers"

Can you remember
Remember my name
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Ooooh and cold
Cold spirits of ice (ice ice)
All my life
I am the echo of your past

I am returning
The echo of a point in time
In distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
Ooooh and laughing
As the spirits appear
Ooooh all your life
Shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers

Oooooh ooh

I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow
Oh

A strand of silver
Hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind
Ooooh is aching
With the dead of the night
Precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers

"The Rover / Achilles Last Stand / The Song Remains The Same"

[I. The Rover]

[Instrumental]

[II. Achilles Last Stand]

It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turn to you you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Woah the songs to sing
When we at last return again yeah
Oh
Oh

Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
To know the streets the seaman hears
The devil in his hole
Oh to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah
Oh
Ooh

Into the sun the south the north
Lies the first of hope
Shackles of commitment fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd yeah
Oh oooh

To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
With guidance from the curving path
That churns up into stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah
Ooooh

Oh

[III. The Song Remains The Same]

Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah
Here we go
Wanted to know, oh oh
Sing out Hare, Hare, oh
Dance the Hoochie Koo
The city lights
Oh so bright
As we go sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding
Through
Oooh
All right

[I. In The Flesh?]

So 'ya
Thought 'ya
Might like to
Go to the show

To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind this cold eyes?
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise

Lights...
Roll the sound effects...
Action...
Shout out! (shout out)

[III. Bohemian Rhapsody]

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby
Can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here

[IV. Loving, Touching, Squeezing]

You make me weep
And wanna die
Just when
You said we'd try
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other

When I'm alone
Oh by myself
You're out
With someone else
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other

You're tearin' me apart
Every day, every day
You're tearin' me apart
Oh what can I say?
You're tearin' me apart

It won't be long, no
Until you're alone
When you're lover
Oh he hasn't come home
'Cause he's lovin', oh he's touchin', he's squeezin'
Another

He's tearin' you apart
Every day, every day
He's tearin' you apart
Oh girl what can you say?
'Cause he's lovin', touchin', another
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry

"6:00"

[Samples from the film "The Dead", an adaptation of James Joyce's short story from his book]
"Six o'clock on a Christmas morning..."
"And for what?"
"Well, isn't it for the honor of God, Aunt Kate?"
"I know all about the honor of God, Mary Jane."

Six o'clock the siren kicks him from a dream
Tries to shake it off but it just won't stop
Can't find the strength but he's got promises to keep
And wood to chop before he sleeps

I may never get over
but never's better than now
I've got bases to cover

He's in the parking lot and he's just sitting in his car
It's nine o'clock but he can't get out
He lights a cigarette
and turns the music down
but just can't seem to shake that sound

Once I thought I'd get over
but it's too late for me now
I've got bases to cover

Melody walks through the door
and memory flies out the window
and nobody knows what they want
'til they finally let it all go

The pain inside
coming outside

So many ways to drown a man
So many ways to drag him down
Some are fast and some take years and years
Can't hear what he's saying when he's talking in his sleep
He finally found the sound but he's in too deep

I could never get over
Is it too late for me now?
Feel like blowing my cover

Melody walks through the door
and memory flies out the window
and nobody knows what they want
'til they finally let it all go

But don't cut your losses too soon
'cause you'll only be cutting your throat
And answer a call while you still hear at all
'cause nobody will if you won't

[Samples from the film "The Dead", an adaptation of James Joyce's short story from his book]

"Caught In A Web"

Silence disguised
I watch you
Show me the hurt
that haunts you
would you despise the thrill
If all you hide were mine?

I can't hold on any longer
These feelings keep growing stronger
Echoes that deafen the mind
will bury my voice in their wake

Caught in a Web
Removed from the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning the lies
devised in my head
Caught in a Web refused by the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning a cage denied and misread

I've seen the path
the one you take
shows the truth
for you to make
This turn of phrase
we might not see
is the thirst of desire
found so easily

Try to push me 'round
the world some more
And make me live in fear
I bare all that I am
made of now
Attractive I don't care
'Cause even when I danced with life
no one was there to share

Does this voice the wounds of your soul?
Does this voice the wounds of your soul?

Caught in a Web
Removed from the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning the lies
devised in my head

Tried to live the life
you live and saw
It doesn't work for me
I bare all that I am
made of now
Attractive, I can't be
Inside the Dance of Life is one
I'll never hold to me

You can't heal the wounds of my soul.
You can't heal the wounds of my soul.

Caught in a Web
Removed from the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning the lies
devised in my head

Caught in a Web
Refused by the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning a cage
Denied and misread

"Innocence Faded"

Animation
breathes a cloudless mind
Fascination
leaves the doubting blind
Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead
the faithful live Awake
the rest remain misled

Some will transcend spinning years
One as if time disappears

Innocence faded
the mirror falls behind you
Trinity jaded
I break down walls to find you

Callow and vain
fixed like a fossil, shrouding pain
Passionless stage
Distant like brothers
Wearing apathetic displays
Sharing flesh like envy in cages
Condescending
Not intending to end

Some will transcend spinning years
One as if time disappears

Innocence faded
the mirror falls behind you
Trinity jaded
I break down walls to find you

Beginnings get complicated
the farther we progress
Opinions are calculated
Immune to openness

Beyond the circle's edge
We're driven by her blessings
Forever hesitating
Caught beneath the wheel

Innocence faded
the mirror falls behind you
Cynically jaded
The child will crawl to find you.

"Voices"

'Love, just don't stare'
He used to say to me
every Sunday morning
The spider in the window
The angel in the pool
The old man takes the poison
Now the widow makes the rules

'So speak, I'm right here'
She used to say to me
not a word, not a word
Judas on the ceiling
the Devil in my bed
I guess Easter's never coming
So I'll just wait inside my head

Like a scream but sort of silent
living off my nightmares

Voices repeating me
'Feeling threatened?
We reflect your hopes and fears.'
Voices discussing me
'Others steal your thoughts
they're not confined
within your mind.'

Thought disorder
Dream control
Now they read my mind on the radio
But where was the Garden of Eden?

I feel elated
I feel depressed
Sex is death, Death is sex
Says it right here on my Crucifix

Like a scream but sort of silent
living off my nightmares

Voices protecting me
'Good behavior
brings the Savior
to his knees.'
Voices rejecting me
'Others steal your thoughts
they're not confined
to your own mind.'

[Dialogue by rap artist Prix-mo reading from the book "Cultural Revolution".]
"I don't wanna be here, 'cause of my
suffering, 'cause of my illness.
Only love is worth having, only
love is what matters, loving every
people on equal terms. "
"You've got to know who you're
dealin' with because, like a stranger,
a-heh, just might come in through
here with a gun... and then, what
would you do? (Heh.)"
"Everything is immaterial..."
"'n' you know that reality is immaterial."
"This is not reality..."

I'm kneeling on the floor
staring at the wall
like the spider in the window
I wish that I could speak
Is there fantasy in refuge?
God in politicians?
Should I turn on my religion?
These demons in my head tell me to

I'm lying here in bed
Swear my skin is inside out
Just another Sunday morning

Seen my diary on the newsstand
Seems we've lost the truth to quicksand
It's a shame no one is praying
'Cause these voices in my head
keep saying...

'Love, just don't stare.'
'Reveal the Word when you're
supposed to'
Withdrawn and introverted
Infectiously perverted
'Being laughed at and confused
keeps us pleasantly amused
enough to stay.'

Maybe I'm just Cassandra fleeting
Twentieth century Icon bleeding
Willing to risk Salvation
to escape from isolation

I'm witness to redemption
heard you speak but never listened
Can you rid me of my secrets?
Deliver us from Darkness?

Voices repeating me
'Feeling threatened?
We reflect your hopes and fears.'
Voices discussing me
Don't expect your own Messiah
This neverworld which you desire
is only in your mind.

"The Silent Man"

A question well served,
'Is silence like a fever?'
'A voice never heard?'
'Or a message with no receiver?'

Pray they won't ask
Behind the stained glass
There's always one more mask

Has man been a victim
of his woman, of his father?
if he elects not to bother,
will he suffocate their faith?

Desperate to fall
Behind the Great Wall
That separates us all

When there is reason
Tonight I'm Awake
when there's no answer
Arrive the Silent Man

If there is balance
tonight He's Awake
If they have to suffer
There lies the Silent Man

Sin without deceivers
A God with no believers
I could sail by
on the Winds of Silence
And maybe they won't notice
But this time I think
It'd be better if I swim

When there is reason
Tonight I'm Awake
When there's no answer
Arrive the Silent Man
If there is balance
Tonight he's Awake
But if they have to suffer
There lies the Silent Man

"The Mirror"

Temptation-
Why won't you leave me alone?
Lurking Every Corner, everywhere I go

Self Control-
Don't turn your back on me now
When I need you the most

Constant pressure tests my will
My will or my won't
My Self Control escapes from me still...

Hypocrite-
How could you be so cruel
and expect my faith in return?

Resistance-
Is not as hard as it seems
When you close the door

I spent so long trusting in you
I trust you forgot
Just when I thought I believed in you...

[Sample is Meryl Streep from the film "Falling In Love".]
"What're you doing?
What're you doing?"

It's time for me to deal
Becoming all too real
living in fear-
Why did you lie and pretend?
This has come to an end
I'll never trust you again
It's time you made your amends
Look in the mirror my friend

[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".]
"That I haven't behaved as I should"
[Sample is Mary Beth Hurt from the film "Light Sleeper".]
"Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you."
[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".]
"I thought you could control life, but it's not like that. There are things you can't control."

Let's stare the problem right in the eye
It's plagued me from coast to coast
Racing the clock to please everyone
All but the one who matters the most

Reflections of reality
are slowly coming into view
How in the hell could you possibly forgive me?
After all the hell I put you through

It's time for me to deal
Becoming all too real
living in fear-
Why'd I betray my friend?
Lying until the end
Living life so pretend
It's time to make my amends
I'll never hurt you again

"Lie"

Daybreak
at the bottom of lake
it's a hundred degrees I can't breathe
And I won't get out
'til I figure it out
Though I'm weak like I can't believe
So you tell me 'trust me' l can trust you
Just let me show you
But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt
'cause I don't know if I know you

Doing fine but don't waste my time
Tell me what it is you want to say
You sin, you win, just let me in - hurry
I've been out in the rain all day
So you tell me 'trust me' I can trust you
as far as I can throw you
And I'm trying to get out of a shadow of doubt
'cause I don't know if I know you

Don't tell me you wanted me
Don't tell me you thought of me
I won't, I swear I won't
(Did)
I'll try, I swear I'll try
(Lie)

Mother Mary quite contrary
Kiss the boys and make them wary
Things are getting just a little bit scary
It's a wonder I can still breathe

Never been much of a doubting Thomas
but nothing breaks like a broken promise
You tell me 'bout your two more coming
but once is just enough for me

Don't tell me you wanted me
Don't tell me you thought of me
I won't, I swear I won't (did)
I'll try, I swear I'll try (lie)

I had gotten used to being a soul destroyed
She comes in apparently to fill the void
All dogs need a leash and
at least I'll forget it
And she would never hurt me though
she's never said it
But I'm not gonna ask her today
I don't wanna scare her away
Your town, I'm all alone
and I just can't stare at the phone
I wanna talk about lifelong mistakes
and you can tell your stepfather I said so

"Lifting Shadows Off A Dream"

He seems alone and silent
thoughts remain without an answer
Afraid and uninvited
he slowly drifts away

Moved by desire and fear
Breaking delicate wings

Lifting shadows
off a Dream once broken
She can turn a drop of water
Into an ocean

As the rain is pouring down
Tears of sorrow wash his mind
Drifting with the current
This stream of life flows on

He seems alone and silent
waiting on his hands and knees
The chill of winter's darkness sits quietly

Moved by desire and fear
he takes a few steps away

Lifting shadows
off a Dream once broken
She can turn a drop of water
Into an ocean

And she listens openly

He pours his soul into the water
reflecting the mystery
She carries him away
and the winds die slowly

And she listens openly
And she listens openly

Lifting shadows
off a Dream once broken
She can turn a drop of water
Into an ocean

Lifting Shadows off a Dream
Lifting Shadows off a Dream

"Scarred"

To Rise, To Fall.
To Hurt, To Hate.
To Want, To Wait.
To Heal, To Save.

Can't hear it
we fear it
awareness won't come near it

Distractive
Reactive
Disguised in spite of time

I never bared my emotion
My passion always strong
I never lost my devotion
but somewhere fate went wrong

Can't let them rape me again
Your venom's not family here
won't let them fill me with
fatalistic remedies

What if the rest of the world
was hopelessly blinded by fear?
Where would my sanctity live?
Suddenly nobody cares.

It's never enough
You're wasting your time
Isn't there something I could say?
You don't understand
You're closing me out
How can we live our lives this way?

You tell me I'm wrong
I'm risking my life
Still, I have nothing in return
I show you my hands
You don't see the scars
Maybe you'll leave me here to burn.

What if the rest of the world
was hopelessly drowning in vain?
Where would our self pity run?
Suddenly everyone cares.

Blood...Heal me
Fear...Change me
Belief will always save me
Blood...Swearing
Fear...Staring
Conviction made aware

Give up on misery
Turn your back on dissent
Leave their distrust behind
Wash your hands of regret

Do you feel you don't know me anymore?
And do you feel I'm afraid of your love?
And how come you don't want me asking?
And how come my heart's not invited?
You say you want everyone happy
Well, we're not laughing.

And how come you don't understand me?
And how come I don't understand you?
Thirty years say we're in this together
So open your eyes.

People in prayer for me
everyone there for me
Sometimes I feel I should face this alone
My soul exposed
It calms me to know that I won't

Blood...Heal me
Fear...Change me
Belief will always save me
Blood...Swearing
Fear...Staring
Conviction made aware

Give up on misery
Turn your back on dissent
Leave their distrust behind
Wash your hands of regret

Blood...Heal me
Fear...Change me
Belief will always save me
Blood...Swearing
Fear...Staring
Conviction made aware

Learning from misery
Staring back at dissent
Leaving distrust behind
I'm inspired and content

"Space-Dye Vest"

Falling through pages of Martens on angels
Feeling my heart pull west
I saw the future dressed as a stranger
love in a space-dye vest

Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding
a pool in the shape of a heart
Beauty projection in the reflection
Always the worst way to start

[Sample is Julian Sands from the film "A Room With A View".]
"But he's the sort who can't know
anyone intimately, least of all a
woman. He doesn't know what a woman
is. He wants you for a possession,
something to look at like a painting or an ivory box.
Something to own and to display. He doesn't want you to be real,
or to think or to live. He doesn't love you, but I love you.
I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and
feelings, even when
I hold you in my arms. It's our last chance... It's our
last chance..."

Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it
Learning to swallow the rage
Found a new girl I think we can make it
as long as she stays on the page

This is not how I want it to end
And I'll never be open again

[Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".]
"...I was gonna move out...ummm...get,
get a job, get my own place, ummm,
but... I go into the mall where I
want to work and they tell me, I'm,
I was too young..."

[Sample is Jim Hill from a news commentary about the OJ Simpson freeway chase.]
"Some people, gave advice before,
about facing the facts, about
facing reality. And this is, this
without a doubt, is his biggest
challenge ever. He's going to have to face it.
You're gonna have to try, he's gonna to have to try and,
uh, and, and, and get some help here. I mean no one can
say they know how he feels."

[Sample from the Conan O'Brien show.]
"That, so they say that, in ya know
like, Houston or something, you'd
say it's a hundred and eighty degrees,
but it's a dry heat.
In Houston they say that?
Oh, maybe not. I'm all mixed up.
Dry until they hit the swimming pool."

[Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".]
"...I get up with the sun... Listen.
You have your own room to sleep in,
I don't care what you do. I don't
care when. That door gets locked,
that door gets locked at night by nine o'clock.
If you're not in this house by nine o'clock, then you'd
better find some
place to sleep. Because you're not going to be a bum in
this house.
Supper is ready..."

There's no one to take my blame
if they wanted to
There's nothing to keep me sane
and it's all the same to you
There's nowhere to set my aim
so I'm everywhere
Never come near me again
do you really think I need you

I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.
I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.

And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend
And I'll never be open again
And I'll have no more dreams to defend
And I'll never be open again

"Pull Me Under"

Lost in the sky
Clouds roll by
and I roll with them
Arrows fly
Seas increase
and then fall again

This world is spinning around me
This world is spinning without me
Every day send future to past
Every breath leaves me one less
to my last

Watch the sparrow falling
Gives new meaning to it all
If not today nor yet tomorrow
then some other day

I'll take seven lives for one
And then my only father's son
As sure as I did ever love him
I am not afraid

This world is spinning around me
The whole world keeps
spinning around me
All life is future to past
Every breath leaves me one less
to my last

Pull me under Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is set it right

Dust fills my eyes
Clouds roll by
and I roll with them
Centuries cry
Orders fly
and I fall again

This world is spinning inside me
The whole world is
spinning inside of me
Every day sends future to past
Every step brings me closer
to my last

Pull me under Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
Living my life too much in
the sun
Only until your will is done

"Another Day"

Live another day
Climb a little higher
Find another reason to stay
Ashes in your hands
Mercy in your eyes
If you're searching for a silent
sky...

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So die another day

The coldness of this words
The message in his silence,
"Face the candle to the
wind..."
This distance in my voice
Isn't leaving you a choice
So if you're looking for a time
to run away...

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So try another day

They took pictures of our
dreams
Ran to hide behind the stairs
And said maybe when it's right
for you, they'll fall
But if they don't come down
Resist the need to pull them in
And throw them away
Better to save the mystery
Than surrender to the secret

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So try another day

"Take The Time"

Just let me catch my breath...
I've heard the promises
I've seen the mistakes
I've had my fair share of tough breaks
I need a new voice, a new law, a new way
Take the time, reevaluate
It's time to pick up the pieces,
Go back to square one
I think it's time for a change

There is something that I feel
To be something that is real
I feel the heat within my mind
And craft new changes with my eyes
Giving freely wandering promises
A place with decisions I'll fashion
I won't waste another breath

You can feel the waves coming on
(It's time to take the time)
Let them destroy you or carry you on
(It's time to take the time)
You're fighting the weight of the world
But no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind

The unbroken spirit
Obscured and disquiet
Finds clearness this trial demands
And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief
For the fortune lies still in his hands

If there's pensive fear, a wasted year
A man must learn to cope
If his obsession's real,
Suppression that he feels must turn to hope

Life is no more assuring than love
(It's time to take the time)
There are no answers from voices above
(It's time to take the time)
You're fighting the weight of the world
And no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind

I close my eyes
And feel the water rise around me
Drown the bead of time
Let my senses fall away
I can see much clearer now,
I'm blind

You can feel the waves coming on
(It's time to take the time)
Let them destroy you or carry you on
(It's time to take the time)
You're fighting the weight of the world
But no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind

Find all you need in your mind
If you take the time
Find all you need in your mind
If you take the time

"Surrounded"

Morning comes too early
and nighttime falls too late
And sometimes all I want to do
is wait
The shadow I've been hiding in
has fled from me today

I know it's easier to walk away
than look it in the eye
But I will raise a shelter to the sky
and here beneath this
star tonight I'll lie
She will slowly yield the light
As I awaken from the longest
night

Dreams are shaking
Set sirens waking up tired eyes
With the light the memories
all rush into his head

By a candle stands a mirror
Of his heart and soul she
dances
She was dancing thru the night
above his bed

And walking to the window
he throws the shutters out
against the wall
And from an ivory tower hears
her call
"Let light surround you"

It's been a long, long time
He's had a while to think it over
In the end he only sees the
change
Light to dark
Dark to light
Light to dark
Dark to light

Heaven must be more than this
When angels waken with a kiss
Sacred hearts won't take the
pain
But mine will never be the same

He stands before the window
His shadow slowly fading from
the wall
And from an ivory tower hears
her call
"Let the light surround you"

Once lost but I was found
When I heard the stained glass
shatter all around me
I sent the spirits tumbling
down the hill
But I will hold this one on high
above me still
She whispers words to clear my mind
I once could see but now at last
I'm blind

I know it's easier to walk away
than look it in the eye
But I had given all that
I could take
And now I've only habits left
to break
Tonight I'll still be lying here
Surrounded in all the light

"Metropolis - Part I - "The Miracle And The Sleeper""

The smile of dawn arrived early May she carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear to tell her of fear and of sorrow and pain she'll never outgrow
Death is the first dance, eternal

There's no more freedom
The both of you will be confined to this mind

I was told there's miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire
As a child, I thought I could live without pain without sorrow
As a man I've found it's all caught up with me I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid

Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
Eluding stares from faces before me
It hides away and will never be heard of again
Deceit is the second without end
The city's cold blood teaches us to survive
Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive the third arrives

Before the leaves have fallen before we lock the doors there must be the third and last dance
This one will last forever Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles she's taken you to your home
It can only take place when the struggle between our children has ended
Now the Miracle and the Sleeper know that the third is love Love is the Dance of Eternity

"Under A Glass Moon"

Tell me
Remind me
Chase the water racing from
the sky
Always beside me
Taste the memories running
from my eyes
Nervous flashlights scan my
dreams
Liquid shadows silence their
screams
I smile at the moon
Chasing water from the sky
I argue with the clouds
Stealing beauty from my eyes

Outside the soundness of your
mind
Bathing your soul in silver tears
Beneath a blackened summer sky
Praying for time to disappear

Beneath a summer sky
Under glass moonlight
Night awaits the lamb's arrival
Liquid shadows crawl
Silver teardrops fall
The bride subsides to her
survival

By your hand
I've awakened
Bear this honor in my name

<|endoftext|>

"Wait For Sleep"

Standing by the window
Eyes upon the moon
Hoping that the memory
will leave his spirit soon

She shuts the doors and lights
And lays her body on the bed
Where images and words are
running deep
She has too much pride to pull
the sheets above her head
So quietly she lays and waits
for sleep

She stares at the ceiling
And tries not to think
And pictures the chains
She's been trying to link again
But the feeling is gone

And water can't cover her
memory
And ashes can't answer her
pain
God give me the power to take
breath from a breeze
And call life from a cold metal
frame

In with the ashes
Or up with the smoke from the
fire
With wings up in heaven
Or here, lying in bed
Palm of her hand to my head
Now and forever curled in my
heart
And the heart of the world

"Learning To Live"

There was no time for pain
No energy for anger
The sightlessness of hatred
slips away
Walking through winter streets
alone
He stops and take a breath
With confidence and self-
control

I look at the world and see no
understanding
I'm waiting to find some sense
of strength
I'm begging you from the
bottom of my heart to show
me understanding

I need to live life
Like some people never will
So find me kindness
Find me beauty
Find me truth
When temptation brings me to
my knees
And I lay here drained of
strength
Show me kindness
Show me beauty
Show me truth

The way your heart sounds
makes all the difference
It's what decides if you'll endure
the pain that we all feel
The way your heart beats
makes all the difference
In learning to live
Here before me is my soul
I'm learning to live
I won't give up
Till I've no more to give

Listening to the city
Whispering its violence
I set out watching from above
The 90s bring new questions
New solutions to be found
I fell in love to be let down

Once again we dance in the
crowd
At times a step away
From a common fear that's all
spread out
It won't listen to what you say
Once you're touched you stand
alone
To face the bitter fight
Once I reached for love
And now I reach for life

Another chance to lift my life
Free the sensation in my heart
To ride the wings of dreams
into changing horizons
It brings inner peace within my
mind,
As I'm lifted from where I've
spilt my life
I hear an innocent voice
I hear kindness, beauty and
truth

The way your heart sounds
makes all the difference
It's what decides if you'll endure
the pain that we all feel
The way your heart beats
makes all the difference
In learning to live
Spread before you is your soul
So forever hold the dreams
within our hearts
Through nature's inflexible
grace
I'm learning to live

"A Fortune In Lies"

"For the first time in a long time
...everything was right in my
world... and then I woke up."

I can remember when,
In the unity of our five-day sessions
Not even once did we hear the siren
song
What kind of imagination
Asleep in some lyrical coma
Who's vain futile memory
Could have been so wrong?

You can make a fortune in lies
You can keep a giant alive
You can ride the red
Until everybody smiles
A trifling euphoria
was such an untimely religion
maybe your life can explain
the reason for my indecision
Here is a poor man
the heart of this monster creation
He said we both will be heroes
and I was led into temptation

You can make a fortune in lies
You can keep a giant alive
You can ride the red
Until everybody smiles

Can you show me your gold
and your silver?
A hero in frozen water

Now you've made a fortune in lies
and you kept a giant alive
You rode the red
You rode the red

"Status Seeker"

Heart sick at the sight of the
Status Seeker
In a sense I'm not beyond reproach
the aspiration to drop a name
When any rose might smell the same
Maybe you'll figure it out someday
"I want to know you now...
You know I've always believed in you."

Nothing is sacred...
You draw the bottom line
with a dollar sign
Change of opinion...
At the drop of a dime
Graceless intrusion...
Are you sanctified in your
judgment of me?
All that I deserve is what you were
unable to see

In a garden where the seeds were
spilled
I favored the few that stood strong
in the sun
As I reached for the profit of my prize
I found I had trampled the forgotten
ones

Nothing is sacred...
You draw the bottom line
with a dollar sign
Change of opinion...
At the drop of a dime
Graceless intrusion...
Are you sanctified in your
judgment of me?
All that I deserve is what you were
unable to see

You're running in circles
And I'm turning away
You refused to believe
Now I'm turning away

Nothing is sacred...
You draw the bottom line
with a dollar sign
Change of opinion...
At the drop of a dime
Graceless intrusion...
Are you sanctified in your
judgment of me?
All that I deserve is what you were
unable to see

You're running in circles
And I'm turning away
You refused to believe
Now I'm turning away

"The Killing Hand"

[I. The Observance]
An Angel's kiss now fallen
Descending scarlet cuts the sky
Faded names left on the wall
Honor the fighting leave life to
die

Remembered is the sacrifice but
No praisal of blood still flowing
Who were the leaders?
what controlled the Killing Hand
that caused this mouthing?

Crossing over...

[II. Ancient Renewal]
Lowered deep into the sea
Being a waits to cleanse his soul
senses weakening time is still
Motionless by stiffening cold

The wheels race back and
Scorch his mind
Travelling all to find the land
Revelation warms a touch
And now he will begin to
Understand

[III. The Stray Seed]
Extended a view to yesterday
Manifestation for none the same
Walking amidst a frightening still
No sound, no smoke, no scorching
Flames

He is risen...

Sipping his poison the raven sings
Yet another to add more bodies
fallen
King from below
this one controls
the Killing Hand that caused this
mourning

Is it all over?

[IV. Thorns]
Evil genius this secret plan
Mercy dealt with the losing hand
Will he ever fall?
Can he end it all?
Our savior must make his stand

Only a Propher of years to come
Wanting mortality I'm all alone
He heard my voice
It was my choice
I've stopped the Killing Hand

[V. Exodus]
When I go back again
Will it be the same?
I've stopped the cries
But now they know my name

The sea is calling me
my spirit must return
As I get closer,
was it really worth
what I have learned?

I'm in the valley
And the saddened chimes I hear
Race towards the wall to find
one more name appears

No one is left now
my one and only land
I laugh at what I've done
I am the Killing Hand

"Light Fuse And Get Away"

Would you like to sit and talk to me
about the way things change so
suddenly
when your senses come and the feeling
goes?
can you remember feeling much
too close?

Stop your hands from shaking.
Look at me.
Are your senses racing endlessly
tracing
past impressions? So were mine.
Have you ever been used
or will this be the first time?

It's come so clear to me
Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
It's a fatal game
and the true lose everything

I can see
what trust and loyalty have done
for me
falling miles from the mark
with a thirst for revenge
and a dangerous heart

I've tried to wash from memory
feelings of betrayal and the incidents
that plague me since I lost my sense
of innocence

A history of changes now I'm loving
now I'm losing keeps me constantly
in fear of hearing "I can't see where
this is going"

You lie alone with the memory
feeling the ceiling and walls closing
in on
Your Conscience - my ally
the guilt - your affliction
from preying on praise as you fed
an attention addiction

Someone told me
Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
and when it's lust to dust you can
crawl from the wreckage

I can see
what trust and loyalty have done
for me
lying bleeding in the dark
with a thirst for revenge
and a dangerous heart

It's come so clear to me
Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
It's a fatal game
and the true lose everything

I can see
what trust and loyalty have done
for me
falling miles from the mark
with a thirst for revenge
and a dangerous heart

"Afterlife"

I touched with one
who made me run
away from my own soul...
In this world with its
many illusions
We are moving like mice through a
maze

And now I find
what's left behind
has served to make me whole
full of doubt, deception, and delusion
seeking purpose to all earthly days

I search within
beneath a skin
that bears both pleasure and pain
In a world full of constant confusion
I will not be a par to the craze

In the Afterlife
will dark be bright?
will cold be warm?
will the day have no night?
In the Afterlife?
will the blind have sight?
In the Afterlife

Behind closed eyes
some comfort lies
In knowing the truth never spoken
Through this world with us
hidden conclusion
we'll keep moving like mice through
a maze

In the Afterlife
will dark be bright?
will cold be warm?
will the day have no night?
In the Afterlife?
will the blind have sight?
In the Afterlife

In the Afterlife
will dark be bright?
will cold be warm?
will the day have no night?
In the Afterlife?
will the blind have sight?
In the Afterlife

"The Ones Who Help To Set The Sun"

Watching my window I was led like a
child
As the roadway lamplights
misguided my mind through the night
a shadow of limits
We were racing the rain
my hands held the wheel
My eyes tried to hold their place

there must have been a time
when I thought that you were
watching
It had to be when my senses lost
control
I thought I'd slipped away
I thought I could still feel us
moving
It must have been a cloud
no bigger than a man's hand

Every reason I risk my life
To come back to you
Is locked behind your door
You're my immunity
Outside I watched you burn
Heavy hearts were bleeding
A cry for help, a familiar voice
My melting hands streaked the glass

As I walked away
I wondered what had really
happened
had I run out of time
did I push myself too far
As my last step fell
I felt my hands upon the wheel
had I come back to life
or did I ever leave at all

In higher lives
We seem to be
always a moment too late
We're past the time
when we looked on
Now we're
THE ONES WHO HELP TO
SET THE SUN
this time for real
I locked the door behind me
My mind was still a wreck
from what I saw
For when my hands are still
I'll recognize the message
never again will my senses lose
control
In higher lives
We seem to be
Always a moment too late
We're past the time
when we looked on
Now we're
THE ONES WHO HELP TO
SET THE SUN

"Only A Matter Of Time"

A suited man smiled said:
"It's just a matter of time
You can have the world at your feet
by tomorrow
just sign on this line."
Hold tight... limelight!
Approaching the paramount
with the sun in our eyes
fearing family ties, legalies,
compromise

In a dimly lit room with a stool as his
stage
a dream-stricken prince of a pauper's
descent
haunts the eavesdropping silence
that presses his window
as he sweats a performance
to an audience that ticks on the wall

To the practical observer
It's just a matter of time
"You can deviate from the com-
monplace
only to fall back in line."
I understand mine's a risky plan
and your system can't miss
But is security after all a cause
or symptom of happiness?

Brave, yet afraid, his eyes on horizon
in a steady-set gaze
a mariner soon from an open cocoon
takes a moment to summon his courage
to stifle his grave apprehension and
trembling, approaches the surf
A father's benediction as his hopeful
son departs
to brave the sea of rage and conquer
at all costs

lingers in his memory
and visions still surviving in a logic-
proof shell
that should have been held sacred, safe
and hidden well
are compromised in usury
with every rising sun that yields no
sight of land
the hesitation cultivates within the
tired man
and rumors spread of mutiny
and though the time will come when
dream and day unite
tonight the only consolation causing
him to fight
in fearless faith in destiny

Even when plans fall to pieces
I can still find the courage
with promise I've found in my faith

Likely or not, it's a dream that we keep
and at odds with our senses we'll climb
But if faith is the answer, we're already
reached it
And if spirit's a sign
then it's only a matter of time
