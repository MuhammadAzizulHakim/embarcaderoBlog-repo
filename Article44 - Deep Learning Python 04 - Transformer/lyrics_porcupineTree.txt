"Harridan"

Gold man bites down on a silver tongue
Takes a deep breath and blows the candle out
He knows the truth but he keeps it to himself
Here it is
You can only save yourself
Only yourself

When we bite the dust
We will hide our cuts from the world
When you're in the dirt
You don't show your hurt to the world
When we bite the dust
We will hide our cuts from the world
When you're in the dirt
You don't show your hurt to the world

Cold man, white knuckles on the wheel
Well it's all just there to steal
You just gotta take it
Take it like the harridan you are

When we bite the dust
We will hide our cuts from the world
When you're in the dirt
You don't show your hurt to the world

It's the time of the almost rain without you
I am in debt to night
And gone to earth for love
And I, a shadow
And what of us?
And what of me?
And what is left without you?

When we bite the dust
We will hide our cuts from the world
When you're in the dirt
You don't show your hurt to the world

It's the time of the almost rain without you
I am in debt to night
And gone to earth for love
And I, a shadow
And what of us?
And what of me?
And what is left without you?

"Of The New Day"

Hold your fear in check my dear
It's got no place here
There's no need to fight
Just drift away on the new day

Find yourself a better way
To meet the future
It's all that you crave
A silhouette of the new day

Walk away from what you love
And all your people move into fog
But live again on the new day

Raise your head and fill your lungs
Breathe the autumn
Shame to be down
In this thrall of the new day

The hour of almost rain
When night becomes the day

Daily finds you tearing out
All the pages
That held all your thoughts
When you dreamed of the new day

It's not the world that shrinks from you
It's the old days
That line up behind
The monolith of the new day

The hour of almost rain
When night becomes the day

"Rats Return"

Leave your principles at the door
Spare me
Purge your guilt for the nameless hoards
Thrill me, you clown

You always beat the system somehow
Now the rats return to take their bow

A dog wakes inside the carnivore
A heart bleeds
A conscience won't help you to win the war
So fool me, you fraud

You always beat the system somehow
Now the rats return to take their bow

Genghis K
Pinochet
Mao Tse Tung
Kim Il-Sung

"Dignity"

Lost boy
With the shreds of your shoes on your feet
And the schoolgirls called you a freak
Long gone
With all that you are in a bag
(Watching you fumble)
And a paper cup held in your hand

You have your pride, you're standing your own ground
Your dignity will never go, and your mind is pretty sound
You stare at the sun
You screw up your face, and then you're done

Lost soul
Camped at the side of the road
And the rain rises up through your toes
Brave man
With the egg running down past your nose
(The future was yours, how it came to this no one knows)
All the troubles you've had, no one knows
(Nobody knows)

You have your pride, you're standing your own ground
Your dignity will never go, and your mind is pretty sound
You stare at the sun
You screw up your face, and then you're done

Outside where the traffic cowers
And the past begins to fade away
Tell yourself it's just what the thunder said
So pack up your belongings and stop talking with yourself

All the friends I have, I made you a list
Even if it's true, they don't all exist

(All the friends I have, I made you a list
Even if it's true, they don't all exist)

Slack jaw
Will you tell me of all that you were?
And the promises you made to her
Drink up
You can tell me of all that you've seen
While we wait for the light to turn green

You have your pride, you're standing your own ground
Your dignity will never go, and your mind is pretty sound
You stare at the sun
You screw up your face, and then you're done

"Herd Culling"

Son, go fetch the rifle now
I think there's something in the yard
I can see the herd is getting rattled
And the dogs are on their guard

Liar
Liar
Liar
Liar

Well, we came to make a home here
But there's something in the trees
We bolt the door, chain the gate, secure the homestead
But it's never gonna leave

Liar
Liar
Liar
Liar

The wolf is at the door somehow
The culling of the herd is now
The wolf is at the door somehow
The culling of the herd is now
The wolf is at the door somehow
The culling of the herd is now
The wolf is at the door somehow
The culling of the herd is now

Hey, did you curse this place?
Did you fall to earth to cull the herd?
Strange gods above the earth
These things you just won't believe

In the shackles of the night
There are lights up in the sky
Scratching at the doors
They are coming through the walls
20 feet above the ground
They move without a sound
Among the garbage cans
A curse upon the land

Liar

"Walk The Plank"

This ship is now under water
And the rats will never find their way back again
And my span, it gets shorter (1, 2, 3)
And I don't appear to my fit my skin anymore

Somewhere else descends the rain in western ways
Upon the echo of the day
Just the ebbing of the day

See how
They hang 'em high
And slap each other's backs
While the waters rise

Somewhere else descends the rain in western ways
Upon the echo of the day
Just the ebbing of the day

Walk the plank, abandon ship
Take it slow, don't lose your grip
Walk the plank and jump out of the fray

Walk the plank, abandon ship
Take it slow, don't lose your grip
Walk the plank and jump out of the fray

Walk the plank, abandon ship
Take it slow, don't lose your grip
Walk the plank and jump out of the fray

"Chimera's Wreck"

A coat of arms is all we are
The slow decay, dying star
A sinkhole for the crawling of the hours

Afraid to be (afraid to be) what I should be (what I should be)
The sum of all (the sum of all), of new and old (of new and old)
Experience has made me none the wiser

I'm afraid to be happy and I
Couldn't care less if I was to die
I'm afraid to be happy and I
Couldn't care less if I was to die, oh
(Do, dododooo, dodododododooo, doooo)

Chimera's wreck around my neck
To start again, to dream again
To fix the things that cursed me from the start

My father smiles (my father smiles); me, the child (me, the child)
Getting tired (getting tired), losing drive (losing drive)
The clarity that age has brought to me

[?] for tomorrow
Even when the rain comes, we can still find a future in tomorrow

I'm afraid to be happy and I
Couldn't care less if I was to die
I'm afraid to be happy and I
Couldn't care less if I was to die
Oh

I'm afraid to be happy and I
Couldn't care less if I was to die
I'm afraid to be happy and I
Couldn't care less if I was to die, whoa

(Do, dododooo, dodododododooo, dododooo do doo)
(Do, dododooo, dodododododooo, dododooo do doo)
(Do, dododooo, dodododododooo, dododooo do doo)
(Do, dododooo, dodododododooo, dododooo do doo)

Here's the things I did with my kids
Here's the way I loved and I kneeled
Here's the things I did with my kids
Here's the way I loved and I kneeled

I'm afraid to be happy and I

Couldn't care less if I was to die, whoa
I'm afraid to be happy and I
Couldn't care less if I was to die

Wash up on the shore
Don't need you no more
Chimera wreck will slip into the bottle wreck
Wash up on the shore
Don't need you no more
Chimera wreck will slip into the bottle wreck
Wash up on the shore
Don't need you no more
Chimera wreck will slip into the bottle wreck

"Never Have"

You need, but you'll never have
You dreamed, but you never had the chance to be
What you wanna be
You grasp, but you never hold
You ask, but you're never told
'Cause the truth hurts
This is the modern world

So you bide your time
With your fate resigned
To be paid in kind

You reach, but you never get
You breathe, but you never let the past go
Do you ever learn?
You search, but you never find
You hurt, but you never try to face facts
This is the modern world

So you bide your time
With your fate resigned
To be paid in kind
When the flashbulb dies
And the humdrum thrives
Do you lose your pride?

You need, but you'll never have
You dreamed, but you never had the chance to be
What you wanna be
You grasp, but you never hold
You ask, but you're never told
'Cause the truth hurts
This is the modern world

"Love In The Past Tense"

One hundred rooftops stretch
Across a crowded skyline in relentless melt
The smog and cigarettes
Poisoning the well for those below alone

You beautiful young soul
I bend to you forever and I trust in you
I lose all self-control
Lay the nest with feathers
Wave goodbye to youth
(Love in the past tense)

Falling back to earth
We get what we deserve
Strength to split the sky
What is born will die
In time
Love in the past tense

We always end up here (We always end up here)
Where nothing feels the same and all our dreams capsize
We ran out of ideas (We ran out of ideas)
And hold each other's promise for one final time
(Love in the past tense)

Falling back to earth
We get what we deserve
Strength to split the sky
What is born will die
In time
Love in the past tense

(Love in the past tense
Love in the past tense)
Love in the past tense
Love in the past tense
(Love)

"The Blind House"

If you wanna stay
Always here
All these years
The last frontier
It's no concern of theirs
The world outside
Corrupts my child
So trust these eyes

Faith is in your soul
But in these walls
Hormones stall
Dogs will crawl
The vices and the doubt
We resist
All this shit
So kneel submit

Free love
Free love
Feel love in all my sisters
Breathe out
Blind house
You don't need to know their secrets
Believe me

Pray and violate
Abuse your trust
False gods must
Purge their lust
A family that lies
To seal your fate
To take the weight
Of their self-hate

Free love
Free love
Bring love to all my sisters
Breathe out
Blind house
You don't need to know their secrets
Believe me

Breathe out
Blind house
Free love
Feel loved

"Great Expectations"

A summer day
In garlands I feel secure
A useless faith
That I will get you, somehow

Reach out, I wonder where you are now

Hey, there's you
With placid eyes
Oblivious to what's to come

They locked you up
So I forgot you
Forgot your name, so strange
I wonder if you got out

"Kneel And Disconnect"

Kneel and disconnect
And waste another year
Fill the application
Start a new career

"Drawing The Line"

Camphor crossed with lace, it is the witching hour
Cinematic but crude
Teasing all my feelings out, you move away
It seems so natural to you

Still siren, climbing up the victory tower
Like there's something left to prove
I trap the beads of sweat that run between my eyes
And free the fever to move

I'm drawing the line, I'm drawing the line
I'm drawing the line, I draw the line
And I have my pride
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
And I save my soul
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
And I have no doubt

Dreamt the sound of scissors, cutting stitches out
Then discarding the used
Recording all my problems onto memory cards
Your compassion unmoved

Onto others what they always do to you
The most twisted of your rules
Distill malaise and photograph the hole it leaves
Running out a copy for you

I'm drawing the line, I'm drawing the line
I'm drawing the line, I draw the line
And I have my pride
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
And I save my soul
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
And I have no doubt

"The Incident"

At junction 8 the traffic starts to slow
Artilleries of braking lights and bluish glow
Ascending in a plumage of twisted steel
Shattered glass and confetti dashed upon the wheel

When a car crash gets you off you've lost your grip
When a fuck is not enough you know you've slipped
When the church is full it means you've just been had
When the world has gone to seed you're so detached

Got a feeling that I want you to be there

Driving by on my way to somewhere else
I fill my lungs with a noxious burning smell
There is weed and grey concrete like this for miles
Dead souls in my rear view mirror hitch a ride for a while

I want to be loved

<|endoftext|>

"Your Unpleasant Family"

Your unpleasant family,
smashed up my car
(perfectly uncalled for)

Your unpleasant family,
how vile they are
(I crawled out of the wreckage on my knees)

It's alright my flower
so what did we learn?
(there I found regret amongst the trees)

Snaps of a life,
We had in the garden,
We tear up the flowers

"Time Flies"

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced?

Into a suburb of heaven
Yeah, it should've been forever
It all seems to make so much sense

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
'Cause time flies

She said luck is all you make it
You just reach out and take it
Now let's dance a while

She said nothing ever happens
If you don't make it happen
And if you can't laugh then smile

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
'Cause time flies

And laughing under summer showers
Is still the way I see you now

How does time break down
With no marker, things slow down.
A conference of the strange
And your family is deranged

I could tell you what I'm thinking
While we sit here drinking
But I'm not sure where to start

You see there's something wrong here
I'm sorry if I'm not clear,
Can you stop smoking your cigar?

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
'Cause time flies

And the coat your wore to Alton Towers
It's still the way I see you now

"Octane Twisted"

We go following sorrow to feel your
Blood spilling out of the reeds there
Give me a sign I can breathe air
Blood flowing out of the stream there

(give me something new please, something I can love)

<|endoftext|>

"The Seance"

Under gas light the joining of hands
Chanting a name over and over

A table tilts the circle is broken
Doubting no more
They pay what they owe her

Disembodied a luminous hand
Holding the air, passing the current
A voice is channeled, a rope is uncoiled
Flicker the light
And someone is here

We go following sorrow to feel your
Blood spilling out of the reeds there
Give me a sign I can breathe air
Blood flowing out of the stream there

(give me something new please, something I can love)

"I Drive The Hearse"

When this freedom stains my coat
With the winter in my throat
When I'm lost I dig the dirt
When I fall I drive the hearse

And silence is another way
Of saying what I wanna say
And lying is another way
Of hoping it will go away
And you were always my mistake...

Given time I fix the roof
Given cash I speak the truth

And silence is another way
Of saying what I wanna say
And lying is another way
Of hoping it will go away
And you were always my mistake...

When I'm down I drive the hearse

When this boredom wears me out
Then the sky begins to cloud
Sleeping with my ball and chain
When she cries I take the blame

And pride is just another way
Of trying to live with my mistakes
Denial is a better way
Of getting through another day
And silence is another way
Of saying what I wanna say
And lying is another way
Of hoping it will go away
And you were always my mistake...

When I'm down I drive the hearse

"Flicker"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light to come
Only the people who always think they know best

"Bonnie The Cat"

Can't feel the pain that I expected
I still place keys in the ignition
I know what will be
One thought is stopping me from sleeping
I saw the future and it's breeding
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

There are three things that I would die for
But I am sure you're not one of them
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

[Whispered:]
You think you've got it all wrapped up now
You stumble on so unsuspecting
I know what will be)

I hold your birth control to ransom
The cells divide and grow inside you
I know what will be

I know what will be

I know what will be

"Black Dahlia"

You have no interest in the past
Where you came from
Where you're going to

There's a cliche in your eye
File the edges down
Soon be underground

There's nothing here for you under the sun
There's nothing new to do, it's all been done
So put your faith in another place

Never seem to get away from this
It's all falling into an abyss
So put your foot on the pedal boy

All you know is secondhand
The bullet passed through the cage inside you

You stole the only thing you love
So unfaithful, the drop is fatal

<|endoftext|>

"Remember Me Lover"

I didn't want to feel like a slave to your mood swings
And I'm not saying anything I wouldn't say behind your back
And all this shit could have happened to anyone
All that matters now is how you gonna pick it up to throw it back

It's so hard to get along
I always know what you're gonna say
This too: I hated you
I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut

I never meant to start anything that I couldn't finish
Now I gotta be the one to turn away, it's time to react
I meant every word that I said, yeah I really did
But you gotta understand that I was sleeping then
So relax

I walked away, now remember me lover
I told you lies, now remember me lover
I took your money, remember me lover
I ruined your life, now remember me lover

It's so hard to get along
I always know what you're gonna say
This too: I hated you
I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut

I've been through this with you about a hundred times
Agree to disagree, start again, with our lives
Then every single morning I wake up and you're still there
But tomorrow you will be alone and that is all you deserve

I walked away, now remember me lover
I told you lies, now remember me lover
I took your money, remember me lover
I ruined your life, now remember me lover

It's so hard to get along
I always know what you're gonna say
This too: I hated you
I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut

"Fear Of A Blank Planet"

Sunlight coming through the haze
No gaps in the blinds
To let it inside
The bed is unmade,
Some music still plays

TV, yeah it's always on
The flicker on the screen
A movie actress screams
I'm basking the shit flowing out of it

I'm stoned in the mall again
Terminally bored
Shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting is getting so last year's thing

X-Box is a god to me
A finger on the switch
My mother is a bitch
My father gave up ever trying to talk to me

Don't try engaging me
The vaguest of shrugs
The prescription drugs
You'll never find a person inside

My face is Mogadon
Curiosity has given up on me
I'm tuning out desires
The pills are on the rise

How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here

I'm through with pornography
The acting is lame
The action is tame
Explicitly dull
Arousal annulled

Your mouth should be boarded up
Talking all day with nothing to say
Your shallow proclamations
All misinformation

My friend says he wants to die
He's in a band, they sound like Pearl Jam
Their clothes are all black
The music is crap

In school I don't concentrate
And sex is kinda fun, but just another one
Of all the empty ways of using up the day

How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here

Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with this boredom
Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with this boredom

You don't try to be liked
You don't mind
You feel no sun
You steal a gun
To kill time

You're somewhere
You're nowhere
You don't care
You catch the breeze
You still the leaves
So now where?

"My Ashes"

All the things that I needed
And wasted my chances
I have found myself wanting

When my mother and father
Gave me their problems
I accepted them all

Nothing ever expected
I was rejected
But I came back for more

And my ashes drift beneath the silver sky
Where a boy rides on a bike but never smiles
And my ashes fall over all the things we said
On a box of photographs under the bed

I will stay in my own world
Under the covers
I will feel safe inside

A kiss that will burn me
And cure me of dreaming
I was always returning

And my ashes find a way beyond the fog
And return to save the child that I forgot

And my ashes fade among the things unseen
And a dream plays in reverse on piano keys

And my ashes drop upon a park in Wales
Never-ending clouds of rain, and distant sails

<|endoftext|>

"Anesthetize"

A good impression of myself
Not much to conceal
I'm saying nothing
But I'm saying nothing with feel

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining please

Because of who we are
We react in mock surprise
The curse of "there must be more"
So don't breathe here,
Don't leave your bags

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining please

The dust in my soul
Makes me feel the weight in my legs
My head in the clouds
And I'm zoning out

I'm watching TV
But I find it hard to stay conscious
I'm totally bored
But I can't switch off

Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV, cod philosophy

We're lost in the mall
Shuffling through the stores like zombies
What is the point?
What can money buy?

My hand's on a gun
And I find the range, God tempt me
What did you say?
Think I'm passing out

[x2]
Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV, cod philosophy

Water so warm that day (water so warm that day)
I counted out the waves (I counted out the waves)
As they broke into shore
I smiled into the sun

The water so warm that day
I was counting out the waves
And I followed their short life
As they broke on the shoreline
I could see you
But I couldn't hear you

You were holding your hat in the breeze
Turning away from me in this moment
You were stolen as black across the sun

Water so warm that day (water so warm that day)
I counted out the waves (I counted out the waves)
As they broke into shore (as they broke into shore)

"Sentimental"

I never wanna be old
And I don't want dependents
It's no fun to be told
That you can't blame your parents anymore.

I'm finding it hard to hang from a star
I don't wanna be...
Never wanna be old.

Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way wish away each day

I don't really know
If I care what is normal
And I'm not really sure
If the pills I've been taking are helping

I'm wasting my life
Hurting inside
I don't really know
And I'm not really sure...

Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way wish away each day

"Way Out Of Here"

Out at the train tracks I dream of escape
But a song comes onto my iPod
And I realize it's getting late

I can't take the staring and the sympathy
And I don't like the questions,
"How do you feel?"
"How's it going in school?"
"Do you wanna talk about it?"

Way out, way out of here
Fade out,
Fade out, vanish

I'll try to forget you
And I know that I will
In a thousand years
Or maybe a week

I'll burn all your pictures
Cut out your face

The shutters are down and the curtains are closed
And I've covered my tracks
Disposed of the car

And I'll try to forget even your name
And the way that you look when you're sleeping,
And dreaming of this

Way out, way out of here
Fade out,
Fade out, vanish

<|endoftext|>

"Sleep Together"

This means out
This is your way out
Do or drown
Do or drown in torpor

Leave no trace
All my files erased
Burn my clothes
Burn my Prada trainers

Let's sleep together right now
Relieve the pressure somehow
Switch off the future right now
Let's leave forever

This is fate
This is your escape
Leave here now
Leave here like it's over

Let's sleep together right now
Relieve the pressure somehow
Switch off the future right now

Let's leave forever

"Deadwing"

And something warm and soft just passed through here
It took the precious things that I hold dearer
It rifled through the grey and disappeared
The creeping darkness makes the small hours clearer

Like a cancer scare
In the dentist's chair
Sucking in the air
Wire across the stair
Kicking down the door
At your local store
With the world at war
Voices through the floor
Unexpected news
Wearing high heeled shoes
Blowing out the fuse
Paying all your dues
Deadwing lullaby
Like a fracture tied
It's a worthless lie
To the public eye

I don't take waifs and strays back home with me
My bleeding heart does not extend to charity

Yes I'd have to say I like my privacy
And did you know you're on closed circuit TV? So smile at me

And a dream you had
Of your mum and dad
On a beach somewhere
And the poison air
With the cancer threat
In a cigarette
Deadwing lullaby
Find a place to hide

And from the yellow windows of the last train
A spectre from the next life breathes his fog on the pane
I look with you into the speeding black rain
Afraid to touch someone, afraid to ask her for her name

And in the morning when I find I have lost you
I throw a window open wide and step through

<|endoftext|>

"Shallow"

I don't remember
Did something in my past create a hole?
Don't use your gender
To drive a stake right through my soul

I live to function
On my own is all I know
No friends to mention
No distraction, nowhere to go

Shallow, shallow Give it to me
Scissors cutting out your anger
Shallow, shallow No good to me, not if you bleed
Bite your tongue, ignore the splinter

This city drains me
Well maybe it's the smell of gasoline
The millions pain me
It's easier to talk to my PC

<|endoftext|>

"Lazarus"

As the cheerless towns pass my window
I can see a washed out moon through the fog
And then a voice inside my head, breaks the analogue
And says

"Follow me down to the valley below You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"

I survived against the will of my twisted folk
But in the deafness of my world the silence broke
And said

"Follow me down to the valley below You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"

"My David don't you worry
This cold world is not for you
So rest your head upon me
I have strength to carry you"

(Ghosts of the twenties rising Golden summers just holding you)

"Follow me down to the valley below You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
Come to us, Lazarus
It's time for you to go"

<|endoftext|>

"Halo"

God is in my fingers God is in my head
God is in the trigger God is in the lead

God is freedom, God is truth
God is power and God is proof
God is fashion, God is fame
God gives meaning, God gives pain

You can be right like me
With God in the hole you're a righteous soul
I got a halo round me, I got a halo round me
I'm not the same as you
Cos I've seen the light and I'm gaining in height now
I got a halo round me, I got a halo round me
I got a halo round my head

God is on the cell phone God is on the net
God is in the warning God is in the threat

"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here"

Never stop the car on a drive in the dark
Never look for the truth in your mother's eyes
Never trust the sound of rain upon a river
Rushing through your ears

Arriving somewhere but not here

Did you imagine the final sound as a gun?
Or the smashing windscreen of a car?
Did you ever imagine the last thing you'd hear as you're fading out was a song?

All my designs, simplified
And all of my plans, compromised
All of my dreams, sacrificed

Ever had the feeling you've been here before?
Drinking down the poison the way you were taught
Every thought from here on in your life begins
And all you knew was wrong?

Did you see the red mist block your path?
Did the scissors cut a way to your heart?
Did you feel the envy for the sons of mothers tearing you apart?

<|endoftext|>

"Mellotron Scratch"

A tiny flame inside my hand
A compromise I never planned
Unravel out the finer strands

And I'm looking at a blank page now
Should I fill it up with words somehow?

I whispered something in her ear
I bare my soul but she don't hear

The scratching of a mellotron
It always seemed to make her cry
Well maybe she remembers us
Collecting space up in the sky

Nothing rises from my feet of clay, but it's OK
Red mist spreads across my fingertips, ardour slips

I lay her gently on my clothes
She will leave me yes I know

And I'm looking at a blank page now
Should I fill it up with words somehow?

The scratching of a mellotron
It always seemed to make her cry
Well maybe she remembers us
Collecting space up in the sky

Nothing rises from my feet of clay, but it's OK
Red mist spreads across my fingertips, ardour slips

Don't look at me with your mother's eyes or your killer smile
Sing a lullaby

Don't look back into black
Don't let the memory of sound drag you down
To end as friends so painful
Don't look down
Shut it down

<|endoftext|>

"Open Car"

Nothing like this
Felt in her kiss
Cannot resist her
Fell for her charm
Lost in her arms
I keep a photograph
Give me a glimpse
Let me come in
Be there inside her
Here it begins
Here is the sin
Something to lie about

You think you're smart
I think you're art
We agree on this
It doesn't work
Feeling like dirt
Feeling like you don't care
We get a room
And in the gloom
She lights a cigarette
Clothes on the bed
Love me she said
I lose myself to her

I'm getting feelings
I'm hiding too well
(Bury the heart shaped shell)
Something broke inside my stomach
I let the pieces lie just where they fell
(Being with you is hell)

Hair blow in an open car
Summer dress slips down her arm
Hair blown in an open car

OK what's next?
After the sex
What do we now?
Finding the time
Drawing the line
And never crossing it
Gave her the hours
Gave her the power
Cannot erase her
Gave her the truth
Gave her the proof
I gave her everything

I'm getting feelings
I'm hiding to well
(Bury the heart shaped shell)
Something broke inside my stomach
I let the pieces lie just where they fell
(Being with you is hell)

Hair blow in an open car
Summer dress slips down her arm
Hair blown in an open car
On a drive out to the farm
Hair blown in an open car

Hair blown in an open car
Summer dress slips down your arm
Hair blown in an open car.

"The Start Of Something Beautiful"

Always in my thoughts you are
Always in my dreams you are
I got your voice on tape, I got your spirit in a photograph
Always out of reach you are

Cold inside my arms you are
Simple like a child you are
I remember when you took my hand and led me through the rain
Down inside my soul you are

The more I show the way I feel
The less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know
The less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent
Forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful?
Well think again.

Mother lost her looks for you
Father never wanted you
I trust to love and then I find you never really felt the same
There's something in your heart so cruel

<|endoftext|>

"Glass Arm Shattering"

Feeling all your touching
Feeling all your blood
Feeling all your touching
Feeling all your love

Seen it through a windscreen
Seen it through the glass
Seen it in a bad dream
Seen it in your heart

<|endoftext|>

"She's Moved On"

You move in waves
You never retrace
Your newest craze
Straight out of the Face by the bed unread

I'm left behind
Like all the others
Some fall for you
It doesn't make much difference if they do

She changes every time you look
By summer it was all gone - now she's moved on
She called you every other day
So savour it it's all gone - now she's moved on

So for a while
Everything seemed new
Did we connect?
Or was it all just biding time for you?

<|endoftext|>

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make up runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my urges bled
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
Swim with me into your blackest eyes

A few minutes with me inside my van
Should be so beautiful if we can
I'm feeling something taking over me

<|endoftext|>

"Trains"

Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hiss of the train at the railway head

Always the summers are slipping away

A 60 ton angel falls to the earth
A pile of old metal, a radiant blur
Scars in the country, the summer and her

Always the summers are slipping away
Find me a way for making it stay

When I hear the engine pass
I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides
I'm in luck

When the evening reaches here
You're tying me up
I'm dying of love
It's OK

<|endoftext|>

"Lips Of Ashes"

Paralysed
Lips of Ashes
Synchronised
Blue vein crashes

Touching you inside

Idolised
Black Eyes fading
You and I
Connection failing

I drill down inside

<|endoftext|>

"The Sound Of Muzak"

Hear the sound of music
Drifting in the aisles
Elevator Prozac
Stretching on for miles

The music of the future
Will not entertain
It's only meant to repress
And neutralize your brain

Soul gets squeezed out
Edges get blunt
Demographic
Gives what you want

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world that no one cares
No one cares enough

Now the sound of music
Comes in silver pills
Engineered to suit you
Building cheaper thrills

The music of rebellion
Makes you wanna rage
But it's made by millionaires
Who are nearly twice your age

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world that no one cares
No one cares enough

"Gravity Eyelids"

Open your eyes now
Hear me out before I lose my mind
I've been waiting for hours
Let the salt flow, feel my coil unwind

Give me a smile please
Count the calm and watch my breathing slow
Winding me up tease
Get inside my head and make it show

Gravity eyelids come down

Touching your oil skin
Slipping hands down past your waist to find
I've been waiting for hours
Let the salt flow, feel my coil unwind
Go to the edge swim
Brown the eyes that sleep has rendered blind

Gravity eyelids come down
Come love so young with your gold arms so I wake her
Here's a will that will glow in the dark

<|endoftext|>

"Prodigal"

I don't know whose side I'm on
I don't think that I belong round here
If I left the stage would that be wrong?

I tried to find myself a better way
I got religion but I went astray
They took my money and I lost my faith

Rain keeps crawling down the glass
The good times never seem to last
Close your eyes and let the thought pass

I tried the capsule and I tried the smoke
I tried to aid escape like normal folk
But I never seemed to get the joke

These are my old clothes
This is a new low
This is my blood flow
This is my headstone

I spend my days with all my friends
They're the ones on who my life depends
I'm gonna miss them when the series ends

Rain keeps crawling down the glass
(Pull yourself together)
The good times never seem to last
(You know it's not so bad)
Close your eyes and let the thought pass
(Close your eyes and let it pass)

"The Creator Has A Mastertape"

He captured and collected things
And he put them in a shed
He raised a proper family
So he could tie them to a bed

The creator had a mastertape
But he left it in a cab
I stared into the void tonight
The best dream I ever had

He worked himself into the ground
And drove a spike into his head
A voice said "Are you happy now?'
Your sordid home is running red

Pills and chloroform
All the pages torn

<|endoftext|>

"Heartattack In A Layby"

I pull off the road
East of Baldock and Ashford
Feeling for my cell
In the light from the dashboard

Hissing from the road
The smell of rain in the air con
Maybe check the news
Or just put a tape on

Lighting up a smoke
I've got this feeling inside me
Don't feel too good

If I close my eyes
And fell asleep in this layby
Would it all subside
The fever pushing the day by

Motor window wind
I could do with some fresh air
Can't breathe too well

(She waits for me. Home waits for me.)

I guess I should go now
She's waiting to make up
To tell me she's sorry
And how much she missed me
I guess I'm just burnt out
I really should slow down
I'm perfectly fine but
I just need to lie down

We'll grow old together
We'll grow old together
We'll grow old together...

"Strip The Soul"

This is my home, this is my own, we don't like no strangers
Raise the kids good, beat the kids good and tie them up
Spread it wide, my wife, my life, push the camera deeper
I can use, I abuse, my muse, I made them all

This machine
Is there to please
Strip the soul
Fill the hole
A fire to feed
A belt to bleed
Strip the soul
Kill them all

They are not gone, they are not gone, they are only sleeping
In graves, in ways, in clay, underneath the floor
Building walls, overalls, getting bored, I got faulty wiring
Brick it up now, brick it up now, but keep the bones

(Do you want a western home in the rubble?)

<|endoftext|>

"Collapse The Light Into Earth"

I won't shiver in the cold
I won't let the shadows take their toll
I won't cover my head in the dark
And I won't forget you when we part

Collapse the Light Into Earth

I won't heal given time
I won't try to change your mind
I won't feel better in the cold light of day
But I wouldn't stop you if you wanted to stay

Collapse the Light Into Earth

"Drown With Me"

So you have been of use
And you have been abused
You know you look pale today
Your lipstick has gone astray
You sold out and lost your looks
You gave away all your books
(You should drown with me)
Your coil has been wound up tight
Unwind it with me tonight
(You should drown with me)
Tyre tracks Fresh on the ground
Where she will be found
Held under the water
Resting there in a stream
View from the cold water
Buried in green
Orange filter sky
Your drowning in family there
When will you come up for air
(You should drown with me)
Don't feel you let 'em down
Cos they have already drowned
(You should drown with me)

"Chloroform"

Little retrograde, wonder where you are
Another motorcade, under radar
A boy in borrowed clothes, knows he is a girl
Shards of light come down, stillness in the air
Big sleeper, your deeper, too deep for me yeah
Speak clearer, can't hear you, I'm going under
On the mountain side, hold me in your gaze
But it's over now, cos I got kids to raise

"Futile"

You were the one that made her cry
You were the one that told her lies
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
Neither an adult or a child

Now it only moves you forward
And back to the blackness at the same time
Burnt out tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
Futile
You were the one collecting space
You were the one just saving face
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
Neither an adult or a child

Now it only moves you forward
And back to the blackness at the same time
Burnt out tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
Futile

"Buying New Soul"

Dried up, a guitar upon my knee
I should have sold out when the devil came for me
Dig a hole and throw it out to sea
Break the code, how happy I could be

I still wave at the dots on the shore
And I still beat my head against the door
I still rage and wage my little war
I'm a shade and easy to ignore

White wall, I had to paint a door
I always find that I've been through it before
Close it up and throw away the key
Break the code, how happy I could be

I woke up and I had a big idea
To buy a new soul at the start of every year
I paid up and it cost me pretty dear
Here's a hymn to those that disappear

<|endoftext|>

"Access Denied"

Access denied
All of the smarter kids they stay inside
But out in the pouring rain
You're kicking me with that look of sheer disdain

The fat controller man
He doesn't understand he's my biggest fan
So I'll stay here on the floor
It's better to be ignored than to be adored

Church spires ticking
Hose pipes hissing

Don't want to smother you
Just want you to be the mother of my children (now)
And you do

Good morning lucky man
I hope you enjoyed your sojourn in Japan
It's such a perfect scene
Back here in Golders Green - cut...end of dream

"Cure For Optimism"

Up there a mountain rises
Down here an ocean dives
A stranger with a head full of lead
Photographs me

Steel bars and a doctor's note
Don't give up
They can plead and beg but don't let them fix your head

Outside a path to knowledge
Inside a waste of cells
A serpent with a mobile phone
Sweet talks me

<|endoftext|>

"Disappear"

We made the world believe we didn't care
We gate crashed parties and just stood and stared
We moved to London and stayed in all year
Standing next to you I disappear

You made a choice for us to live it up
I've got a voice inside me saying give it up
Let's get out of here, let's find a new career
You be famous, and I'll disappear

I erase myself again [3x]

I need security, you favour chance
I ponder everything while you advance
You bring the world to me and I just sneer
In your shadow I disappear

I erase myself again
I erase myself again
(I'm here)
I erase myself again
(I'm here, you're never standing still)
(I'm here)
I erase myself again
(I'm here, you're never standing still)

I'm here, I'm here, you're never standing still [4x]

"In Formaldehyde"

Dust in the kitchen
Coffeepot
Microdots

Now we are coasting
Talking less
Breathing stress

Somewhere inside
I have died
So I will lie
In formaldehyde
People walk
Through my insides

When I get out of here
I get a plastic vase
And you get to keep the car

Or do you want me to stay ?
The things that I have to say
You've heard it all anyway

Send me to sleep
You always could
Fatherhood

Tie up loose ends
Make it stop
Forget me not

And would you really mind
If I told you a millionth time
The story of my decline ?

You never seem to take
The time to contemplate
Before you annihilate

"Even Less (Full Version)"

A body is washed up on a Norfolk beach
He was a friend that I could not reach
He thought I was cold but I understand
But for the grace of God goes another man

And I may just waste away from doing nothing
But I'm a martyr to even less

A choir boy is buried on the moors
Where we used to go dreaming when we were bored
Some kids are best left to fend for themselves
And others were born to stack shelves

And I may just waste away from doing nothing
But I'm a martyr to even less

Fuck you and your book too
You can have it back
When I'm gone these songs will
Will be my tracts

And I had a stupid dream that I could change things
But I'm a martyr to even less

I hate the ground that I have walked upon
Nothing I've done has ever mattered long

"Lightbulb Sun"

The sun is a light bulb
A candle's a treat
The curtains stay closed now
On my little retreat
And I'll only take medicine
If it's followed by sweets
A sickly pink liquid
That puts me to sleep

My head beats a better way
Tomorrow a better day

And I can watch TV
While I'm wrapped up in bed
And mother makes sure that
I'm watered and fed
My best friend from school will
Come over and stare
At me in my bubble
Of germified air

When I'm asleep the smoke fills me
I feel the heat
My illness leaves me

The sun is a light bulb
A candle's a treat
The curtains stay closed now
On my little retreat
But after a while
The noise from the street
Is making me wish I
Was back on my feet

"How Is Your Life Today?"

The letters pile up in the hallway
Junk mail and bills from the catalogues
And the neighbours have guessed 'cos I've cancelled the milk
And they don't hear your voice through the walls anymore

How is your life today ?

I was kissed on the cheek by a cold mouth
While the taxi was waiting like a getaway car
Each second seems like a lifetime
And the cat it's been staring at me all this time

How is your life today ?

"Four Chords That Made A Million"

Six of one a half a dozen
Black guitars and plastic blues
Hide behind a wall of nothing
Nothing said and nothing new

4 Chords that made a million

You belong there on the cover
You are the emperor in new clothes
A man who thinks he owns the future
Will sell your vacuum with his prose

4 Chords that made a million

And then a moron with a cheque book
Will take you out to lunch who knows ?
He will tell you you're a saviour
And then he'll drop you like a stone

4 Chords that made a million

And I have tried and I have died
Trying to get through
But in the end I can't defend you.

"Shesmovedon"

You move in waves
You never retrace
Your newest craze
Straight out of the Face by the bed unread

I'm left behind
Like all the others
Some fall for you
It doesn't make much difference if they do

She changes every time you look
By summer it was all gone - now she's moved on
She called you every other day
So savour it it's all gone - now she's moved on

So for a while
Everything seemed new
Did we connect ?
Or was it all just biding time for you ?

"Last Chance To Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycled"

[a) Winding Shot (Summer 1981)]

If you fall asleep with me
You can dream and drowse
The miuntes turn to hours

We could climb a tree or two
And watch the sun go down
Upon our sleepy town

After all the time I spent with you
Summer went away
And we just weren't the same

It's just you and me alone
Not grown ups but not kids
You kissed me on the lips

"The Rest Will Flow"

I was pretending to be floating strong
But I was sinking
In to still water

Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow

Then out of darkness I found I could still feel
Something good
Out of the woods

Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow

One simple thing that I never could see
But now I know
All of the rest will flow

Stay with me my angel I found you
Now I don't feel low
All of the rest will flow

Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow

"Hatesong"

This is a hate song just meant for you
I thought that I'd write it down while I still could
I hope when you hear this you'll want to sue

Oh it's a lonely life in my empty bed
And it's a quiet life that leaks from my head
These are the last rites
The line is dead

Yes, I'm hearing voices too
And I'm more cut up than you

<|endoftext|>

"Where We Would Be"

Tied - tied to a time
When we knew that the sun would shine
And you were all smiles
And we could just talk for a while...

Of where we would be when the future comes
And how you would paint while I wrote my songs

If I could find you
And tell you about my life
Or maybe just write
And remind you of when we would dream...

Of where we would be when the future comes
And how you would paint while I wrote my songs

Strange how you never become
The person you see when you're young

"Russia On Ice"

You think I deserve this
You said I was stupid
All my thoughts are like coal
But Russia on ice is burning a hole

Can't stop myself drinking
Can't stop being me
If I call will you come and will you save me?

I see the whole thing come down
I burn it to the ground
Well what the hell did you say?
You said you hate me this way
It's just a matter of time

A drop in the ocean
A significant motion
Nothing melts in this cold
But Russia on ice is burning a hole

<|endoftext|>

"Feel So Low"

So see how long I can last
You can pretend that I don't exist for you
And I can laugh about it now
But I hated every minute
I was waiting for your email
And each day that you forgot to call
Just made me feel so low
So low

Christmas 1998
I tried to call
I just couldn't wait
And your message was out of date
So I left my voice on your machine
But you did not respond
OK OK OK you've won
You make me feel so low
So low

"Even Less"

A body is washed up on a Norfolk beach
He was a friend that I could not reach
He thought I was cold but I understand
But for the grace of god goes another man

And I may just waste away from doing nothing
But you're a martyr for even less

A choirboy is buried on the moors
Where we used to go dreaming when we were bored
So some kids are best left to fend for themselves
And others were born to stack shelves

And I may just waste away from doing nothing
But you're a martyr for even less

"Piano Lessons"

I remember piano lessons
The hours in freezing rooms
Cruel ears and tiny hands
Destroying timeless tunes

She said there's too much out there
Too much already said
You'd better give up hoping
You're better off in bed

You don't need much to speak of
No class, no wit, no soul
Forget you own agenda
Get ready to be sold

I feel now like Christine Keeler
Sleepwaking in the rain
I didn't mean to lose direction
I didn't want that kind of fame

(Take your hands off my land)

Credit me with some intelligence
(if not just credit me)
I come in value packs of ten
(in five varieties)

And even though I got it all now
My only stupid dream
Is you and me together
And how it should have been

I remember piano lessons
Now everything seems clear
You waiting under streetlights
For dreams to disappear

<|endoftext|>

"Pure Narcotic"

You keep me waiting
You keep me alone in a room full of friends
You keep me hating
You keep me listening to the Bends

No amount of pointless days
Can make this go away

You have me on my knees
You have me listless and deranged
You have me in your pocket
You have me distant and estranged

No narcotics in my brain
Can make this go away

I'm sorry that, I'm sorry that I'm not like you
I worry that I don't act the way you'd like me to

You find me wanting
You find me bloodless but inspired
You find me out
You find me hallucinating fire

No narcotics in my brain
Can make this go away

Have we ever been here before?
Running headlong at the floor
Leave me dreaming on a railway track
Wrap me up and send me back

<|endoftext|>

"Slave Called Shiver"

I need you more than you can know
And if I hurt myself it's just for show
I found a better way to curb the pain
You put a trigger here inside my brain

Mother I need her
I'm falling apart
Mother I need her
And it's only the start

I may be nothing now but I will rise
I'll have more followers than jesus christ

Through all the smashing things and crashing cars
I love the ground you walk with all my heart

"Don't Hate Me"

A light snow is falling on London
All sign of the living has gone
The train pulls into the stations
And no-one gets off and no-one gets on

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't fight me
I know you'll never care
Can I call you on the telephone, now and then?

One light burns in a window
It guides all the shadows below
Inside the ghost of a parting
And no-one is left, just the cigarette smoke

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't fight me
I know you'll never care
Can I call you, I'm terrified

"This Is No Rehearsal"

How many children did I bring into this world?
How many did I lose in the shopping arcade?

This is no rehearsal - play it back
and throw things at the screen
This is no rehearsal - somebody
interpret this for me

And still I remember how I dressed him this morning
And then he was gone - stolen, my only one

"Baby Dream In Cellophane"

I am - in my pram
Look you - I'm so new I am - sleeping there
Underneath the stairs

If you - wanted to
You'd find - inside my mind
Things so surreal
My lips are sealed

In the rain in cellophane
Pale dogs and demigods
They won't bring me down
The cogs go round, they never stop

I've been - in limousines
I've seen - inside your dreams
It's raining there
Try not to stare

<|endoftext|>

"Stranger By The Minute"

Ghosts in the park
Appear just after dark
Killers, children ...
But no-one has a harp
They look like tourists
It makes me want to laugh

Under floorboards
It's hard to fly a kite
Underwater
My cigarette won't light
Standing in the shade
I'm getting frostbite

Strange as I seem
I'm getting stranger by the minute
Look in my dream
It's getting stranger by the minute

When I'm drowning
You drag me up to you
Rings in the water
My only residue
But you're just fiction
And I'm a twisted boy

<|endoftext|>

"A Smart Kid"

Stranded here on planet earth
It's not much but it could be worse
Everything's free here, there's no crowds

Winter lasted five long years
No sun will come again I fear
Chemical harvest was sown

And I will wait for you
Until the sky is blue
And I will wait for you
What else can I do?

A spaceship from another star
They ask me where all the people are
What can I tell them?

I tell them I'm the only one
There was a war but I must have won
Please take me with you.

"Stop Swimming"

This song leaks out onto the pavement
It could be a joke, it could be a statement
The more that I fake it and pretend I don't care
The more you can read in to what isn't there

Maybe it's time to stop swimming
Maybe it's time to find out where I'm at
What I should do and where I should be
But no-one will give me a map

I'll leave now this can't continue
But I forget which door I came through
And I know that the lift can be painfully slow
So I think I'll leave by the window

<|endoftext|>

"The Sleep Of No Dreaming"

At the age of sixteen
I grew out of hope
I regarded the cosmos
Through a circle of rope
So I threw out my plans
Ran on to the wheel
And emptied my head
Of all childish ideals
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
I married the first girl
Who wasn't a man
And smiled as the spiders
Ran all over my hands
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
Made a good living
By dying it's true
As the world in my TV
Leaked onto my shoes
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming

"Waiting - Phase One"

Waiting... to be born again

Wanting... the saddest kind of pain
Waiting for the day when I will crawl away

Nothing is what I feel
Waiting... for the drugs to make it real
Waiting... for the day when I will crawl away

Waiting... to be disciplined
Aching... for your nails across my skin
Waiting... for the day when I will crawl away

"Sever"

Telepath Carbon trapped under stone
Brother mother pale body is thrown
Only way I know to have fun
Fill up my blood, my veins, my lungs

ESP city - rainy and blue
Burn down this town, I give it to you
Aero shallow, photograph blind
Stage fright, black light, coma divine

No sense of time
Sever tomorrow
Exitless mind - ESP Sever tomorrow

School out invective, losing my voice
Film shredding on in multiple choice
America calls, I must go
Oprah saviour, I feel that low

<|endoftext|>

"Every Home Is Wired"

Modem load and failsafe
Electric teenage dust
Hit the solvent keypad
Start the neural rust

Power on the highway
Data in my head
Surfing on the network
Part of me is dead

Every Home is Wired

Swimming in the circuit
Somebody has expired
This world will be the future

Every home is wired

<|endoftext|>

"Dark Matter"

Inside the vehicle the cold is extreme
Smoke in my throat kicks me out of my dream
I try to relax but its warmer outside
I fail to connect, it's a tragic divide

This has become a full time career
To die young would take only 21 years
Gun down a school or blow up a car
The media circus will make you a star

Dark matter flowing out on to a tape
Is only as loud as the silence it breaks
Most things decay in a matter of days
The product is sold the memory fades

Crushed like a rose
In the river flow
I am I know

<|endoftext|>

"I Find That I'm Not There"

We lost the skyline
We stepped right off the map
Drifted in to blank space
And let the clocks relapse

We laughed the rain down
Slow burn on the lawn
Ghosts across the delta
Swallowed up the storm

Sometimes I feel like a fist
Sometimes I am the colour of air
Sometimes it's only afterwards
I find that I'm not there

In the dream dusk
We walked beside the lake
We watched the sky move sideways
And heard the evening break

<|endoftext|>

"Stars Die"

The moon shook and curled up like gentle fire
The ocean glazed and melted wire
Voices buzzed in spiral eyes
Stars dived in blinding skies

Stars die. Blinding skies.

Tree cracked and mountain cried
Bridges broke and window sighed
Cells grew up and rivers burst
Sound obscured and sense reversed

Stars die. Blinding skies.

[Spoken:]
Hello, Neil and Buzz.
I´m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made from the White House.
I just can´t tell you how proud we all are of what you have done.
For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives.
Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man´s world.
And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.

Idle mind and severed soul
Silent nerves and begging bowl
Shallow haze to blast away
Hyper sleep to end the day

Stars die. Blinding skies.

<|endoftext|>

"Dislocated Day"

A dislocated day
Peers in to the ether
Counts the stars inside the sky
And flies in to the never

Looped around my eyelids
A thousand shining flecks
Pale against the canvas
Which hangs around my neck

Dislocated day
I will find a way
To make you say
The name of your forgiver

Stood beside an inlet
A starfish leads a dance
It dreams it is a human
And falls into a trance

A hole inside my body
Is wired up to a charge
Chemical imbalance
Tells me who you are

Insects hide the silence
November brings deep rain
Between the flow to freezing
And yesterday's sustain

<|endoftext|>

"The Moon Touches Your Shoulder"

Springtime is over
Don't head for home
Creep up the ladder
And steal over stone

No time to forget this
World's in your eyes
Sway in the cloud blur
And light up the sky

Cast off the colour
And tune in to black
The moon touches your shoulder
And brings the day back

<|endoftext|>

"Synesthesia"

I'm sending you a letter
Because I don't think there's much time
Time to clear the cobwebs
Time to bear the crime

It's only a number
It's only a death
Another soldier died in action
The telegram regrets

I'm lying on a stretcher
They're lying to my face
There's no-one left to help me
I'm just a waste of space

It's a matter of moments
I'll be dead before you've read
There's blood on the table
And my back is full of lead

<|endoftext|>

"Always Never"

I feel no pain
Cos I'm an island
I will remain
In the deafness of your silence

I love you sometimes
Always Never
He said you're here
Here with me now

I feel no gain
When you're around me
I'll try again
In the darkness you astound me

It's growing cold
I'm growing old
Is this the only way to see the fire?
It's raining...

<|endoftext|>

"Up The Downstair"

Sleep
Until the colours dissolve
Leave the dream to rain-soak forever
In blessed moments
Viewed from trains of half-truths

Monuments burn into moments
Up into other worlds
Other ascensions
Without deep sorrow to endure

Black Sunday of sleep
Open for small angel escapes
Moved by buildings to tears
They week in the rain
Am I at home?
Am I in heaven?
Gentle Architecture

<|endoftext|>

"Small Fish"

The first thing that I saw as,
the fisherman smiled at me
Were empty people dressed in grey,
floating out to sea
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
The small fish gave a cry

The next thing that I saw as,
things were fading fast
Were dreams of children's laughter,
smouldering to dust
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
The small fish gave a cry

The last thing that I saw as, my life passed by
Were fields of empty people, laying down to die
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
To watch the burning sky.

<|endoftext|>

"Fadeaway"

I sat in the room with a view
The girl in the photograph knew
Can't you see?
Why is she laughing at me?

I stumbled through the dark unaware
The face in the hall isn't there
Tomorrow has gone
Where do the voices come from?

Watching the leaves as they blew
Lost in the room with a view
Climb the walls
You did not know me at all

I fell through a hole in the floor
The audience cried out for more
Fadeaway
It's just another day

Hit heaven far too high.

<|endoftext|>

"Jupiter Island"

Jupiter Island is full of pleasures
Glowing gardens holding hidden treasures
Luminous flowers of yellows and greens
Glittering petals that have to be seen
Here's your chance don't let it pass you by
Take my hand and we'll fly

Jupiter Island is surrounded by oceans
Majestic ballerinas with graceful motions
Magenta forests on a crimson sea
The electric clouds are as vivid as can be
Scarlet moons in a domino sky
Take my hand and we'll fly

Come on let's fly to Jupiter Island
Just take my hand and we'll fly

Jupiter Island is full of mountains
Ruby rivers and sapphire fountains
Chessboard lawns bible black and white
The pink and blue trees are incredibly bright
An orange sunset painted on the sky
Take my hand and we'll fly

Jupiter Island is full of people
But you can't see them unless you want to
Lying in the hay on a hot sunny day
Everyone's happy so no-one's gay
Laughter from the children dances way on high Take my
hand and we'll fly

Jupiter Island is full of meadows
Fertile pastures for growing rainbows
Illuminated portraits from strange orchestrations
Lost in a collage of its own creations
Never a chance to wave goodbye
Take my hand and we'll fly

"The Nostalgia Factory"

A Caterpillar crawled to me one day and said
"Oh what the hell goes on inside your swollen head?
I don't believe that you can see as much as I
Now close your eyes and tell me what do you say?"

"I watched nine cats dance on the moon
A flamingo stalked into my room
It bowed its head to me and knelt
To reveal the cards it had dealt
An ace, three jacks, two queens, four kings
Then turned them into burning rings
The flames jumped out and chased four mice
Caught by their tails they turned to ice

A cloud appeared outside my door
And through the window saw four more
And on the back of each cloud sat
Two rainbow smiles in wizard's hats
They threw five clocks down on my bed
The chimes danced out on golden threads
And turned to footprints on my wall
Sequined tears began to fall"

The caterpillar gasped at me and said
"My god if that's what's going on inside your head
You can see so much more than I
I think it's time to turn into a butterfly."

<|endoftext|>

"Space Transmission"

You must listen very carefully to what I have to say.
There isn't much time, because You Know Who
has consumed all the instruments.

For many eons now I have been trapped on this planet.
He is keeping me here against my will, and sometimes
when I press my ear up very close to the concrete
I can hear his daughters sobbing with laughter.
Either I am blind, or I have been in darkness
ever since the sun exploded fourteen centuries ago.

A few hours ago, He Who Keeps Me Here visited me saying,
"God, why do the millions worship you instead of I �
am I not more powerful, more forgiving and truly compassionate?"

A black liquid was seeping uncontrollably from my mouth
and all I could do was babble incomprehensibly
about a dream I had many moons ago.
In it, a clock ticked constantly, maddening my senses.

That was all, but it lasted for many days
until each tick seemed like fragments of glass piercing my scales.
He Who Keeps Me Here tells me that one day I will return to earth,
and then I will seek my revenge.

"Radioactive Toy"

Run through forests on a hot Summer day
Trying to break down walls of numbing pain

Give me the freedom to destroy
Give me radioactive toy

Taste the water from a stream of running death
Eat the apple and cough a dying breath

Feel the sun burning through your black skin
Pour me into a hole, inform my next of kin

Run through graveyards on a dusty Winter day
Spit the dirt out and try to say...

<|endoftext|>

"Nine Cats"

The butterfly sailed on the breeze
Past a field of barbed wire trees
Where golden dragons chased around
Pampered poppies on the ground
Two silver trout sat way on high
And watched a royal samurai
Plant two black orchids in a box
And strap it to a laughing fox
A minstrel bought a crooked spoon
He gave it to a blue baboon
Who filled it full of virgin snow
And watched it in the afterglow

Fat toad stood in his ballet shoes
Teaching sixteen kangaroos
How to skip across a lake
They found it hard to stay awake
A pharaoh played a merry tune
And watched nine cats dance on the moon
I didn't know what all this meant
I didn't know why I'd been sent.

The Insignificance version of Nine Cats has the
following additional verse at the end:

I threw 5 clocks down on my bed
The chimes danced out on golden threads
And turned to footprints on my wall
Sequined tears began to fall

<|endoftext|>

"Footprints"

I saw her footprints on the sea
I knew her eyes were watching me
So I ventured further in my mind
In the hope that I would find:

"Tangerine Trees and Marmalade Skies and
Plasticine Porters with Looking Glass Ties"

My mind had formed a mental prison
I cried aloud no-one would listen
Then floating through the heavy mist
My vision took a sudden twist

Empty people stood in grey
Children laughing far away
An empty courtyard wept alone
Rain lashed down on darkened stone

A crystal glove points to the door
A threshold I had crossed before
On turning back all I could see
Were her footprints on the sea.

"Linton Samuel Dawson"

Linton Samuel Dawson
Lives in inner space
He hangs around with a circus troupe
Outside the human race

Linton Samuel Dawson
Has just reached 25
Artists travel from outside time
Just to see his rainbow jive

He's bored, He's bored.

Linton Samuel Dawson
Yields his knowledge in a phial
A vivid play on an emerald day
I s experienced in his smile

Linton Samuel Dawson
Visits many open minds
He aids escape to tranquility
From the boredom of mankind

Boredom. From the boredom.
From the boredom of mankind.

"And The Swallows Dance Above The Sun"

I'm sitting in the concrete
I'm listening for a heartbeat
I'm sitting in the painting
I promised I'd be waiting
I'm sitting in the window
I'm listening to the wind blow
I'm sitting in an hour glass
I'm waiting for the march past

I'm sitting in the doorway
I'm wishing for a new day
I'm choking in the landscape
I'm cutting through the red tape
I'm sitting in the concrete
I'm listening for a heartbeat

And the joke has crossed the line
And the final word is mine
And the mist has touched the wood
And the words are understood
And the sand has drifted high
And the blind man gave a cry
And the swallows dance above the sun
And the swallows dance above the sun
Yeah

I'm sitting on the ceiling
I had to know the feeling
I'm sitting in the shelter
I'm going down helter skelter
I'm sitting in the concrete
I'm listening for a heartbeat

Every time I turn around
There's another face watching me
Every time I turn around
There's another voice calling me
Every time I turn around
There's another fool reading me
Every time I turn around
There's another silence drowning me

"The Long Silence"

A systematic killer
Returning from Madrid
Murdered Mozart in his garden
Mussolini ran and hid
He was chosen by his elders
Sitting on the shelf
They passed his heart to Satan
Who showered them with wealth

A Purple Haze crawled on the lawn
Where lonely angels played
And Shakespeare wrote of Vietnam
While a president decayed
Hollow laughter from below
Cracked the sky in two
As Manson dance inside the flames
And the yellow changed to blue

Swinging from a length of rope
Ruth Ellis blew a kiss
Merlin spoke to Norma Jean
And granted her a wish
Mark Chapman stared at fantasy
Bare wires burned his brain
As Sergeant Pepper led the band
Playing through the rain

The third eye on the surface
Opens up my mind
Twin visions in production
This long silence you will find

"It Will Rain For A Million Years"

I locked myself inside the capsule
And watched the planet slowly turning blue
The lights before me flashed and sparkled
Holding keys to lives I've wandered through
Circuits buzzing, visions passing
Mysterious and cold upon the screen
Glowing, flowing with the currents
Yet never knowing where I've really been

The floating seeds of timeless travel
Come to rest in planes that don't exist
Visiting worlds of crystal beauty
Offering dreams so very hard to resist
I've seen the past, I've seen the future
Beyond dimension and into empty space
Finding questions, never answers
living time behind another face
