"Dignity"

"At a year's end many will experience a feeling of melancholy, considering that which will never return. To others it is a moment of anticipation for the possibilities of conquering the new. Others yet will experience a concern facing a change that provides uncertainty and possible deterioration. All of these emotions are each in their own understandable. Someone said the other day that we reside in the great time of rupture."
[Quote by Olof Palme, Swedish prime-minister (S) 1969-1976, 1982-1986, assassinated 1986, murder still unsolved. Words culled from his New Year's speech to the nation 1969]

Prince of lies is on his knees
Holy rites, spreading the disease
By his side a youthful girl
Wedlocked force unfurls
She's young
Far too young

Far too young

Can we dictate a life with dignity?
Foul agenda corrupt in secrecy
Oh no no no no no

One false prayer wielding blasphemy
Price the spirit as a wanted property
Oh no no no no no

Congratulations to the five men of affairs
There was a purpose with this life
Insinuations (that) if she holds anything dear
Then it motivates submission in his lair

He is waiting for darkness
He opens the door
He's slithering

"Heart in Hand"

"It's simply woeful. Yuck!"
"Who the hell are you?"
[Quote from "Skrot-Nisse" by Jan Lööf]

Take it as a threat now and leave
Drop of toxins flows to a habit
Tell me what it is you can't see
Teeth grinding flesh in the sabbat
Factual drowning stream, you believe
Slaves will follow conspiracy
Turn the locks on brother and kin
Murder lust on affinity

War in utopia
Slay cornucopia for symmetry

The parody is real
And we're biding time
And while losing ground, make sure to worship monarchy
Death is but a story in a land of borrowed wealth
The burdened scale weighs heavy with the hunt for dopamine

Intolerance disguised as a faith
In secrecy we shun empathy
Soul critique online far too late
A throne for the devout enemy

War in utopia
Slay cornucopia for symmetry

The parody is real
And we're biding time
And while losing ground, make sure to worship monarchy
Death is but a story in a land of borrowed wealth
The burdened scale weighs heavy with the hunt for dopamine

When I was young
So, so much younger than today
It seemed easier to lead your life
There was no time to surrender
And no reason to perceive
The burden of pain
As it passed through our lives every year somehow
And it never (really) went away
Yet behind my door
Was a kingdom
A secret outline showed the way
To treasures of clay
And beads made of glass

"Yuck!"

"Next of Kin"

Every morrow, every year
Choir of sounds
The final sorrow, so shed a tear

Someone dies within creation
Doubts in everlasting life
How to lie to one innocent child
You are loved, I'm execrated
You belong, I circle strife
Routine pathways in escape from the wild

We are left in a city all alone
In the breathing of ashes
On the earth, one second
Just a piece of meat in essence

Every morrow, every year
Choir of sounds
The final sorrow, so shed a tear

We are left in a city all alone
In the breathing of ashes
On the earth, one second
Just a piece of meat in essence

We are left in a world that's burning
Crawling through embers to safety
And my name is next to last
Feast on famine and death on the broadcast

Finding friends in algorithms
Forgot the sound of my daughter's voice
Please remind me of my emptiness
The hissing of machines lost rhythm
As death would give an interview
In a metropolitan holiness

I am outside waiting
Outside waiting
I am outside waiting
Outside waiting

Am I the last one of my kind,
Who's afraid of dying?
But I would perish to save a child
And give all I can for love
It seems I might have reconciled
Even if my destiny's lying
For the ones I hold dear I hold close
And force my way through the ether

"Lovelorn Crime"

A voice through vapor
20 yards ahead
Is calling for your name
The empty paper
Waiting on the bed
It sets the waiting game

Credits to a dream

You can always strike me down
You can always say I'm wrong
You can always strike me down
But I will always wait for you

Ghost of memories, heavy on my brow
But changing over time
New ambitions corrupting every vow
Unfolding lovelorn crime

Credits to a dream

You can always strike me down
You can always say I'm wrong
You can always strike me down
But I will always wait for you
Yes, I will always wait for you

Three thousand dreams in pale moonlight
Counting...
Three thousand years of Winter's blight
Ticking off against my heart

Here come the months of squalor
Clasp death in his parlor
A sorrow celebration
She canes a thousand creations

Three hundred days in an endless night
The frost smiles
Three hundred weapons on manhunt
Craving more blood to its name

Here come the months of squalor
Clasp death in his parlor
A sorrow celebration
She canes a thousand creations

Cities, violated graves
Yonder distance, perfect slave
You!

"Universal Truth"

Sweat on the brow runs over faces made of snow
There comes a time in life when death may come too slow

Honesty in the necrology
The offspring smear your name in print

You have waited far too long
But Spring is set in bloom
You have conquered love inside
Yet sorrow is your doom

The debts are long since paid, inheritance is set
Still agitation reels inside, lest you forget
Lest you forget

At sunrise Friday morning
A haven for your sins
The written dedication
Etched into your skin

Time won't heal the wounds you bare
Between old pride and desperate prayers

Time won't heal any wounds you bare
A set few years of your life are stolen
Light cast on the obvious
Behold the white when it's faded golden

A stranger's truth holds no water here
But soon we may have learned
Dead sympathy, a aversion proceeds

A voice lives in your chest
That comforts wary thoughts
Yet the brook is still too wide
To bridge the gap you've sought

Honesty in the necrology
The offspring smear your name in print

You trade your vices every day religiously
A pack of vultures wait for everyone to see

You gave away too much, a harness on your kin
For any transgressions never mirrored mortal sin
Mortal sin

You're still alone

The day in zenith now
You made it through the night
Voice of perdition
Came and went far out of sight

"The Garroter"

Lone hunter in the fray
Of a lonely fading light
A manifest for the garroter
Stuck to his plight

Young and elder, nevermind
Programmed mortal set lifeline

A mother says no
And father cracks a simple plan
A knife is sharpened
His children run but he'll advance

Alas, how fragile life can be
Love is strong when death foresees
Yet the story won't end here
No, oh no, oh no

Ulterior motive
The grinning face of leadership
A selfish wish to control
A nation in his grip

Strong against weak and immobilized
Secular for fascist lies

The beautiful people
Look down from ruby vantage points
While in the gutter
Starvation invites us to join

Barricades of wealthy youth
Protesting their inborn truth

"Continuum"

Empty house, and empty pockets
There's an echo in the hall
I keep your picture in a locket
In the past, we had it all
But the Summer fades away
Rainy day tomorrow

In the company of dawning
In the presence of a friend
I was subject to a wanting
And unable to ascend
So I opened up my gate
It's too late to wonder

"It's just another day, nothing special has happened"
[Bruno K Öijer, Swedish poet]

Once there was a moment
Time was on my side
Rust and silk bestowment
Balanced on my pride

You are moving away from home
Escaping the monochrome
One after another
Striding along the road
Past the crest, you will be free
Laid to rest now, let it be
Honest promise to a degree
The edge too sharp for guarantees

Once there was a moment
Time was on my side
Rust and silk bestowment
Balanced on my pride

A part of our past is still there
Underneath your shoes
The memory's stuck in your chest
The idle truth is up to you
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless

Life is so fragile, I know
And even if I heard
A yearning voice in your heart
Old routines always kept us apart
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless

"All Things Will Pass"

Rose of Summer, withered times
Shadows fall on contouring lines
Far beyond a sleeping wish
Lunar tongue on a lasting bliss

Dead within a dream
Icy river stream

Lend yourself...

Clouds of dust in a waning light
You have given up on plight
Time is now, my dearest friend
Hidden years and a heart to mend

And should we meet again
The loss of everything
Three wishes to a friend
Three hundred sorrows gather
But if we lend ourselves
Amidst rock and poison grime
There may well be a time
A kingdom past its prime

Dead within a dream
Icy river stream

Your silver voice in my throat
Potion without an antidote
A routine death for the well-immersed
After all, the years have left us cursed
A simple test in an iron cage
Old tradition in a modern age
Strong and true are the weak at heart
I am you, you am I

If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?
If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?
If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?

"Persephone"

A beloved name inside my heart
A fleeting glance became the start
A missing word I am still awaiting
A wretched deception I am creating

<|endoftext|>

"Sorceress"

I am a sinner and I worship evil
Blood is thinner but you will never know
Can you confess that you thrive in chaos?
You're a sorceress and your eye is on the lost

But you're dying
It's in your eyes

You're a charlatan
You get everything you wish
You're a harlot
Carry poison in your kiss

Beg forgiveness
With a dagger in your hand
Sow your death seed
And reap the dying lands

But you're crying
It's only vice

Empty vessel
Drained of hope
And none the lesser at the end of
A rope
Have you ever hated like I?
Know I still awaited the absence of lies

Watch your eager tongue
Attack me from behind

Riddle whispers
Bleak futile control
Like a twin sister
Adapting to a role

You're a murderer
Bloodlust increase
You're a harvester
Come close to spread disease

And you're hiding
I hear you cry

<|endoftext|>

"The Wilde Flowers"

Sun hangs high, I turn away
Failure underground
Heart is sick and fever is high
Waiting for a sound

Like a trail of insects to me
I watch them from afar
Feeding, breeding, scheming
Tell me I am wrong

Hiding from discovery
Staring down into the ground
Had they seen the posion in me
A tide of spite wound be found

Moving faster lingering gaze
Feasting on my sanity
A grain of sand against endless waves
A wish for the slaughter of conformity

Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre

Inside me sleeps a violence waiting to be freed

[Solo: Åkesson]

Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre

Blinding light and the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Should I speak and they'll call me a liar
I'll retreat to my funeral pyre

My sanctuary, a thousand centuries
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting

"Will O The Wisp"

When you're tired of waiting and time is not on your side
When you're tired of hating me, you no longer want to hide

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

When there's trouble admitting that you have been wrong all along
When the words you have written down reads "everything is gone"

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

When you smother your friendships and take much more than you need
When you can't keep a secret to yourself and points to the source of the deed

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And you can never find the satisfaction
When you can't outgrow your false distractions

"Chrysalis"

And on the furthest day
When you lay down
Discard your disarray
And your rusted crown
And face the wretched image of you and I
No trust in what you say
You are a dead poison seed
Stronger when you're away
You have nothing that I need
The rhyme has settled in the ghost of a sigh
Nothing now remains
Now you will leave me be

Sunrise into the moonlight
A broken body lies in wait
Your prize won you the stark night
And you made peace with your fate
Blind eyes sensitive only to white light
Reacting just a bit too late

Preying on insecurity
A design of your schemes
A true believer of purity
Must tend to what it means
Or allow its gospel to turn into a lie
You forsake everything you feel
In favor of despair
Immune and blind to everything that is real
In your secret lair
And cast away the captive heart that was thine

And you will go and leave me be

Winter in your soul, building a wasteland
And you tread a thin ice 'neath your feet
Sneering and everyone you would shun
Collecting flowers to your wreath
Lifeline, a river cuts deep in your cold hand
It's changing when you try to breathe

[Solo: Åkesson, Svalberg, Åkesson, Svalberg]

Leave it all behind you
There is comfort in giving up
A seed in barren soil
Might curl up into a coil
Flourish into something new
Give back what you thought was "you"
And give way to all that is new

[Solo: Åkerfeldt]

Leave it all behind you

"Sorceress 2"

Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line

And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away

Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line

And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away

Ice melting into the sea
Your river flowing back to me

And when you take your final breath
In many years from now, no less
I hope you feel a peace at heart
Do not be afraid to kiss the dark

And do not ever wonder if I stayed
My love for you cannot die away

"The Seventh Sojourn"

Hold me in your arms
Never do me harm
Never do me harm
Hold me in your arms

A raging sea in your eyes
Gives away your disguise
Grants me the peace to leave
And finally leave you be

"Strange Brew"

An afternoon walk through the park
I keep to the shadows until it's dark
I am not educated nor free of sin
I carry thoughts of giving in

There is a void surrounding me
No sound, and in the black I can not see
There is a chasm between you and me
You have no face, no body, no words to speak

[Solo: Åkerfeldt, Åkesson]

There is a wickedness in me
I cannot seem to make it go away
I am a spiritual leper, but I can see
A flock of believers gone astray
There is eternal night in my gaze
I am cast out and I am not like you
Find my way on through the haze
I am liquefied in a strange brew

An early morn walk through the park
I look to the sun when it's cold and stark

I blend with the crowd of robot minds
Never a leader, I am always behind

[4x]
A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears

<|endoftext|>

"A Fleeting Glance"

Up until recently I have been alone
Leading a tranquil life, but never at home
Something had changed and I turned to the wind
That blew through me and told me,
"How long? How long?"

Silenced the voice of my heart now for years
I was perplexed by a fleeting blank stare
Biding my time until courage had built up inside me
Then came clean
"Or am I wrong"

[Solo: Åkerfeldt]

I spend all my days contemplating my will
For the weak shall inherit the earth
When it's still
A government bid for my life
I was sold as a cog in a machine
"I walk the line"

A fleeting glance again
Tells me everything
Took a chance in vain
Drawn to a futile idea
A pursuit of happiness
As the storm rolls in
An idol of helplessness
Paved the way and then gave in

I met with my mother and I asked her why
For ten years or more she would never reply
Suddenly she said we're all born to die
Gave me purpose
Freed me
"How simple it can be"

But it's fading away from my mind
There's another "me" waiting behind

"Era"

There is a sign in the rain
Every now and again
It's a symbol of hope
In the midst of a catastrophic episode
In the hour of death
There is a spiritual wealth
When we dance through the rain
And form the signs once again

If even for a second

I hear a voice on the air
It has a warning to share
"Do not believe what you see.
You cannot perceive what you feel."
But if I do what I am told
And shun the spirit I hold
I am no longer a human
And I will not shift with the sands

[2x]
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

There are moments of doubt
When I do not know what to do
And giving in is the only way out
When there is too much shouting
About how I should choose
Incapacitated, I am left behind
In a sea of hatred I go blind
A storm is coming, I hide away
In the years of need reason leads astray

[Solo: Åkesson]

[2x]
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

"Persephone (Slight Return)"

The years went by with disquieting grace
A past obsession sunk without a trace
I moved into winter and found my home
As my boiling blood had turned to chrome

<|endoftext|>

"The Ward"

I am going away
I am going down

Sifting through a memory
Before it fades away
Adolescent secrecy
A million words astray

I cannot remember happiness
I thrive within the dark
The security of a loneliness
Is a veil that keeps my calm

By the way, I am doing fine
I have a place to stay, just behind the sunshine
And by the way, I do not need sympathy
I have a place to lay
I have more than you can see

I walk the streets alone at night
It helps to ease my mind
I lay me down come the morning light
And leave all woes behind

"Spring MCMLXXIV"

On a wind that is sailing through the morning
I have cut the harness off of my heart
On a tide that's rising with the dawning
I find I belong inside the dark

And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page

Carry me home

There is a dream that tells me I am haunted
It comes to visit every fortnight or so
I wake up having lost all I have ever wanted
And a bleak apparition wants what I hold

And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page

Carry me home

Should it disappear, should it go away
Would it mend the wounds I bare, the wounds of love
Could it reappear like a familiar tale?
Like a broken friendship that snuffs the moonlight above

"Eternal Rains Will Come"

Eternal rains will come
We should say goodbye
And suffer on our own
As all our thoughts were wrong

So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
And when the flood comes to drown us
There is nothing we can do

You told me not to wait
Unless I could wait forever
Because there is no time for us
Take comfort in what was

So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
And when the flood comes to drown us
There is nothing we can do

Here it comes, our death comes
And in my sleep I can't forget

Reaching for the surface, I see you

"Cusp Of Eternity"

A child of autumn was born
Into a world of deceit and death
And a land of ice
A break of bonds would take her away
And install a sense of loss and eternal sorrow

She walks across the country
She holds her head up high in the rain
A mother is screaming for help
And she turns around to stare
At a scene from her memory

She is hiding a wish in her heart
That flows through her blood always
And it's culled from a dream
That someone is waiting to say her name
And call her to his side at the cusp of eternity

<|endoftext|>

"Moon Above, Sun Below"

You are sleeping unhampered by guilt
Comes the morning you shut down
The devil's breath is a disease on your lips
Reaching out for your loss
You prey on your flock

Seeking out the weaker hearts
With eternity in your grip
And on a lifelong throne of sub-religion
They will eat from your hand

With the moon above and the sun below

I can't remember the sun upon my skin
Slave to a sorrow that is whispering within
I'm always waiting for you before I sleep
There is no comfort in the distance that we keep

In a river of grief I am drowning
And your grip is surrounding my heart
Balancing on the edge of failure
And relieved, should I fall
Scattered dust upon my eyes
A winding road taking you nowhere
A winding road taking me home
And my home is my grave

Waiting for a day when there is nothing left to say

Voices of despair is a familiar friendship
A society in your head holds the code to destruction

Dying fast
Summer dying fast
And this can't last, as nothing ever lasts
In a forest of flesh
There is a need to sever myself away from happiness

Still no drifting sun
Black upon the earth
Still the air is dry
And the locust wait

There is no help in the wake of our needs
There is no help to dispel the pain
There is no help yet some cling to a phantom
There is no help, only circles on the water

Only circles on the water

<|endoftext|>

"Elysian Woes"

What is left when the morning comes
Is the memory of a future
And when my plight is done
There is nothing left to hold on to

There were friends waiting at my door
They are gone now, for the year is new
I stuck by my word
And when the rains came
Made it true and pure, to dissolve the hurt

Are we nursing destruction?
Pursuing a dream we once had
Was it our intention
to follow this road 'til the end
Even if the end is a world of sorrow?

There is a bond between us
Even if it's frayed it is unbreakable
So I come for you always
And I welcome pain
For a second of belonging somewhere
There were times when I lost my way
With hope pouring from my soul
In a shelter from the sun
I don't want to bare my scars for you

<|endoftext|>

"River"

Show me a sign of troubles in your heart
Spare me your lies and tell me that you're mine

And our bodies float on the river
To the oceans of demise

Made me a slave to the secrets of your silence
But you told me to stay
And you told me you're mine

And our bodies float on the river
To the oceans of demise

In light of all things to come, why do you despair?
Because when you have no one, no one would care
So don't care

And all things will come undone
There is nothing to share
I'll be waiting for no one
And no one is there to care

Can't see, can't feel
You run, I long
I wait, he comes
Takes you away

'Cause he can feel you (on the)
On the way to comfort you

In the embers of summer
All things must die
There's a passage of fire ahead
Fire on the other side

There comes a time when the river runs dry
Winter comes and we sacrifice
Our lives

"Voice Of Treason"

The mist is sleeping on the water
And winter is hiding in my heart
Thorns in my eyes are slowing me down
I can't pass through to the other side
She knows I'm the one who sought her
But when we fall, we'll fall so hard
She holds a secret and won't show me how
How to break the riddle in her eyes

This is treason of the mind and soul
There's no reason why you would go

Inside the ghost of love is laughing
It mocks the footsteps where I go
It tells me nothing has been lost
It whispers, "You've seen darkness before."
In time the hurting will subside
And longing is overthrown
What's left is a void that grows inside
And the echo of a failure

This is treason of the mind and soul
There's no reason why you would go

Have you ever had the feeling of a sorrow inside?
Have you ever been the reason why a hope subsides?
Have you ever seen the aftermath of giving up?

Have we given up?
Is it over?
Have you given up?
Is winter hiding in your heart?

"Faith In Others"

The grave of our youth is up ahead
And life has become a burden
We move in circles of suppressed despair
Waiting for the sun
And turning stones to find evidence
But it hides in the recesses of our hearts

Written the creed of our loss
And we carried no faith in the cross
And the cold years are coming
For the victims of a longing

Out through the doors of starvation
And into the rains of damnation
Where the bitter winds are singing
For the victims of a longing

We carried along through squalor
With an inborn need to dominate and possess
It gives birth to an anger inside
And we can't control this
The blood of departure in our tracks
Dripping from our emptying vessels
Your hand reached out to hold mine
But you're grasping melting ice

Asleep in the rain
A child once again
And the ghost in my head
Has forgiven me

Lifted his curse upon me

<|endoftext|>

"The Devil's Orchard"

This trail is obsidian,
The grip of winter uncoiled
A lover would follow me
Cast down and sworn to the dark

Take the road where devils speak
"God is dead"
"God is dead"

The wealth of darkness
Inside you telling you "now"
Your senses corrupted
Controlling a poisonous will

Take the road where devils speak
"God is dead"
"God is dead"

In the corner of my eye
Tearing flesh from bone

Led the blind in search to find
A pathway to the sun
Saw the signs intertwine
And forgave me all my sins

No stigmas revealing our vices
And there are no stigmas revealing our vices

God is dead

<|endoftext|>

"I Feel The Dark"

I feel the dark when I see you
I feel the dark when I see you

Loosen the harness of trust
Survey an impulse of lust
The thespian is far away
Uprooted yet forced to stay

Sing a lie, ghost of the night
Give yourself to me
The road is long and winding still
And these bonds will start to fray
But another day

A flaking wish inside

Veiled comes the daylight through the glass
In the never-ending rain
This is no friend of mine
Stalking the comfort within

A flaking wish inside
The mother of lies

And you're going out to war
When the beast is coming home
And the sun is seen no more
For the devil's love you bore

I feel the dark when I see you

<|endoftext|>

"Slither"

Summer's gone and love has withered
I believe in nothing yet nothing is what it seems
All is gone and promises slithered
You gave me nothing yet nothing is what it seems

Summer is gone

Your eyes gave away all your lies in the end
The dawning of a seething design
Kept a secret from the light
And felt the weight on my shoulders increase

A bleeding heart led my desperation
Like a bird on a wire
A broken promise of dedication
Never ever again

<|endoftext|>

"Nepenthe"

Hope would fail me in the falling snow
And slake a wish inside

Friends would leave me in my darkest hour
Yet trust me with their lives

She would haunt my dreams and feed my demons
They tell me to go

<|endoftext|>

"Häxprocess"

A lifeline in a drop of blood
A dying wish to shun a God
Sought a dream inside the light
Finally relieved from plight

O this night is deceiving
One eternal winter
Earth below and reeling
Moon is riding high

Father and a liar
One forgotten season
Secrets in the mire
Moon is riding high

Aligning

A name inside a memory
Waiting for you
When words can't win her
There is nothing to do

Save your children
Drenched in poverty
Tracks in the snow
Leading them to woe

<|endoftext|>

"Famine"

I can't see your face
And I can't breathe your air
So I wonder why I get cold inside
When I hear your name

When we meet eye to eye
I will ask how and why
And when guilt has its way
One lesser reason to stay
And I will see her cry

Into the fire of our youth comes the devil again
And you feel your way, feel your way

Saw you standing nigh
In the corner
Told me that you had died
And I would die when my heart was empty
Become a ghost in perpetual void
And neglect all reasons why

<|endoftext|>

"The Lines In My Hand"

We are dying in the wake of gods and decrees remain arcane
And everything around us is a consequence of pain

The writings on the wall depict a truth that no one reads
A government of puppets blinded by another creed

Burning voice of insanity
Nothing is the same
Barren lands for the idle man
Find all the lines in your hand

Blinding storms are surrounding us
Take control
In our cups, poisoned wine
Find all the lines in your hands

<|endoftext|>

"Folklore"

Hey you, will you be true
When you can see through what I do
Feel the pain in your brain, insane
Will I see my name in your scars

And you will see what you mean to me

Lust between the lines
Do you feel the need
When the night comes down
And when the night comes down
A father is waiting

And you will see what you mean to me

Lost control and called your name
Left a home in the pouring rain
In a sea of guilt and shame
Will we sustain

<|endoftext|>

"Pyre"

[Bonus Track]

Follow the embers into cities of dreams
What you've been seeing is not all what it seems
Dawn of the liars
Future's a pyre

Outside the window I see people passing by
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry
Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep
I wish this beating would so reveal the love I keep

Look down your senses
Await the gritting beyond
And in the morning this starkness would trail alone

Born as a failure and dying as a stranger
When your country's bleeding while you're forced to mourn

Outside the window I see people passing by
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry
Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep
I wish this beating would so reveal the love I keep

"Bring me back again"

"Face In The Snow"

[Bonus Track]

No more wishes for the past
No lingering of sages and seers
And desperations and fevers last,
The undertows are stronger here.

And here I lie, another morning arrives
Too far away from coming home

I see a face in the snow, inside my head a voice calls for me
I see your face in the snow and outside the sun's too far away to feel

And here I lie, another morning arrives,
Too far away from coming home.

And here I lie, another morning arrives,
Too far away from coming home

And could we live within the wake of aging lies
When we re too far away?

<|endoftext|>

"The Throat Of Winter"

The throat of Winter is upon us
And the cold will linger in me

Sheild of the eternal river again

Our fevered bodies will return
to the bowels of the vast decrepit earth

The devil spoke and called us to his side

Never will return again
Never will I feel the rain
Never will return again
Never will I feel the rain

Throat of Winter

A demigod is observing us through child-like eyes
And his hordes are returning now
A demigod is observing us with child-like eyes
And his hordes are returning now

<|endoftext|>

"Would?"

[Alice In Chains cover]

Know me broken by my master,
Teach thee on child of love hereafter,

Into the flood again,
Same old trip it was back then,
So I made a big mistake,
Try to see it once my way.

Drifting body, it's sole desertion,
Flying, not yet quite the notion.

Into the flood again,
Same old trip it was back then,
So I made a big mistake,
Try to see it once my way.

Into the flood again,
Same old trip it was back then,
So I made a big mistake,
Try to see it once my way.

Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home
Have I gone?
And left you here alone

Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home, yeah
Have I gone?
And left you here alone

If I would, could you?

"Mellotron Heart"

I lost all I had (that April day)
I turned to my friends (nothing to say)
I wrote down a name (and read it twice)
I wallowed in shame

I said that I loved (eternal schemes)
I cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I promise to stay (and held my breath)
I went far away

Icy roads beneath my feet
Lead me through wastelands of deceit
Rest your head now, don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghosts of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now, don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

<|endoftext|>

"Coil"

She told me
Why she told me lies
Always take care of this
I told her how I've always stayed
Always waiting for nothing

[x2]
When I get out of here
When I leave you behind
I'll find that the years passed us by

And I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
Yes I can, see you
Running through the fields of sorrow

[x2]
When you get out of here
When you leave me behind
You'll find that the years passed us by

And I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
Yes I can, see you
Running through the fields of sorrow

"Heir Apparent"

Cold days
Old ways
Told lies
No more

So many years to clean the slate
Endless despair within its wake
His touch soiling what used to be clean
His gaze burning on the edge of our dreams

No more
Cold days
Cold days

And again he rides in
It's September and he covets the gullible
Skeletal wish
Hunter
A thousand lies cast from the throne of secrecy

Hear him spewing forth a meaning to miserable lives
See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair
The insect trust
Believer
Your body a vehicle to him just the same

Pearls before swine they are nothing but blind
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn
Invisible king
Dying
Procession of woe struck down by sorrow

A burden so great weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs
The swift solution crumbles beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece
Death in his eyes
Waiting
Spiralling judgement provoked in the rains

Futile test drowned in the levee of deception
His futile test drowned in the levee of deception

In the year of his sovereign
Rid us of your judgement
Heir apparent

<|endoftext|>

"The Lotus Eater"

The liquid is in your throat
For hopeless delight

After all you fell in love with death,
Life has aborted.
All you've had and all you became,
The night is calling, you pray forth.

The barren waste is your land
Your crops, they were sown to die

The skin is a mirror
The eyes hollow with ignorance
Health runs from your lips
Sucked in and safe in a world of sleep

All those years caring for a liar
A benefit road that is winding higher
You're a moth too close to the fire

You are stuck in a route of confusion
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all

Fleeing your sorrows
Pushing your spirit away

Sick of the weakness of the psyche
A whisper from the heart of evil luring them all into despair
Resenting the goods of a savior

And cries out
For the restless will also die

A selection culled from the damned, drawing a lifeline of one
A friend died in your room and sought the birth of a follower

O brother, you are a killer and you target yourself
I wish you'd never come back for us to see the beckoning end

And the pride of a mother brought flaws in a mother's son
And the love from a father was used by a father's son

Overheard us talking in a smoke of lost hope
The language of a parting so clear and so true
Overheard us talking

<|endoftext|>

"Burden"

I,
Once upon a time,
Carried a burden inside.
I sung a last goodbye,
A broken rhyme
I'd underlined.
There's an ocean of sorrow in you

Sorrow in me

Saw movement in their eyes
Said I no longer knew the way
Given up the ghost
A passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand

Waiting to fail

Failing again

If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear
You've taken more than we've received
And the ocean of sorrow is you

"Porcelain Heart"

[Mikael Akerfeldt]

I lost all I had (that April day),
I turned to my friends (nothing to say),
I wrote down a name (and read it twice),
I wallowed in shame.

I said that I loved (eternal schemes),
I cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I promised to stay (and held my breath)
I went far away.

Icy roads beneath my feet,
Lead me through wastelands of deceit,
Rest your head now, don't you cry,
Don't ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghost of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now, don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reasons why.

"Hessian Peel"

Will the children cry
When their mother dies
And in the autumn of their lives
Will they feel the same?

[reversed lyrics 2:03-2:22:]
"I see you
My sweet Satan
Come back tonight
Out of the courtyard"

Her longing for me
Comin' down like hail
Why did you leave me?

Come here inside
Come tell me how
How in my final days
I found the rout

The light comes on
The signal for us to end our lives
You wait beneath the white sheets and you wait forever

The night comes on
Your weakness starting to erase all your lies
So I left you alone
We all left you alone

[reversed lyrics 7:21-7:24:]
"They'll lock all your reasons why"

Lock the children away from harm
They'll lock all your reason why
Seeking tenderness with a dagger
Skin is blocked by the years of trial

You felt abandoned in the fog of flesh
Sitting in place from the dead
Awaiting the face of the moon to ascend
You follow the siren in your head

In your head

<|endoftext|>

"Hex Omega"

Two years
In your heart
One moment of doubt

Two lives
Torn apart
One second from now

Held him
In your arms
Your fever subside
Always safe from harm
Kept demons inside

Still you always start runnin'
Touch the light
From the moon
Some way mother cried
Left us space here

<|endoftext|>

"Derelict Herds"

[Bonus track]

Someone died for looking too far
While I was asleep in my house
A child was killed, I heard it from a friend
A war raged in a distant land
Cost me to linger on a piece of text

Someone died
Not here, never here

There was a fever
There is a failure
Are you a believer?
That someone lied to you

You hold it closer to your chest
There was a meaning for this test
But you forgot and it's gone now
You were controlled somehow

There was a mean time
An invitation of sorts
I remember life
I, I was sick with sorrow

I'd fallen asleep
And dreamt of my sins here
It was your turn
Adamant smile and said, "Thank you"

There was a sickness right in the family
While I shuddered in the cold
Woman hanged for her sins while I craved mine
An old man drowned in this life herd
As I made amends with my fathers

Someone died
Not here, never here

"Bridge Of Sighs"

[Robin Trower cover]

[x2]
Sun don't shine
The moon don't move
The tides to wash me clean

Why so unforgiving
And why so cold
Spent a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs

[x2]
Cold wind blows
And the gods look down
In anger of this poor child

Why so unforgiving
And why so cold
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs

"Den Ständiga Resan"

[Bonus track]

När jag tänker på den ständiga resan genom livet
När det alltid känns som höst
Då vänder sig vinden sakta mot norr
Och blommorna dör
Det faller regn i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen efter ömhetens röst
Jag måste resa igen till nästa höst
Den ständiga resan till nästa höst

[Guitar]

När jag vandrar på den steniga vägen genom livet
När det känns som jag bar på en sorg
Då gömmer sig solen sakta i moln
Och ordet är adjö
Snart faller snö i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen efter ömhetens röst
Jag måste resa igen till nästa höst
Den ständiga resan till nästa höst
Oh den ständiga resan till nästa höst

[Guitar]

[English translation:]

The Perpetual Journey

When I think of the perpetual journey through life
When it always feels like autumn
The wind moves slowly to the north
And the flowers die
Rain falls in my dreams

I must travel again and search for comfort
I must search again for the voice of tenderness
I must travel again to next autumn
The perpetual journey to next autumn

When I wander on the stony road through life
When it felt like I carried a sorrow
Then the sun hides slowly in the clouds
and [indistinct] goodbye
Soon the snow falls in my dreams

I must travel again and search for comfort
I must search again for the voice of tenderness
I must travel again to next autumn
The perpetual journey to next autumn
Oh the perpetual journey to next autumn

"Ghost Of Perdition"

Ghost of Mother
Lingering death
Ghost on Mother's bed
Black strands on the pillow
Contour of her health
Twisted face upon the head

Ghost of perdition
Stuck in her chest
A warning no one read
Tragic friendship
Called inside the fog
Pouring venom brew deceiving

Devil cracked the earthly shell
Foretold she was the one
Blew hope into the room and said:
"You have to live before you die young"

Holding her down
Channeling darkness
Hemlock for the Gods
Fading resistance
Draining the weakness
Penetrating inner light

Road into the dark unaware
Winding ever higher

Darkness by her side
Spoke and passed her by
Dedicated hunter
Waits to pull us under
Rose up to it's call
In his arms she'd fall
Mother light received
And a faithful servant's free

In time the hissing of her sanity
Faded out her voice and soiled her name
And like marked pages in a diary
Everything seemed clean that is unstained
The incoherent talk of ordinary days
Why would we really need to live?
Decide what is clear and what's within a haze
What you should take and what to give

Ghost of perdition
A saint's premonition's unclear
Keeper of holy hordes
Keeper of holy whores

To see a beloved son
In despair of what's to come

If one cut the source of the flow
And everything would change
Would conviction fall
In the shadow of the righteous
The phantasm of your mind
Might be calling you to go
Defying the forgotten morals
Where the victim is the prey

<|endoftext|>

"The Baying Of The Hounds"

I hear the baying of the hounds
In the distance, I hear them devouring
Pest ridden jackals of the earth
Diabolical beasts and roaming the forests
In wait and constant protectors
Calling you to sit by his side
Your self loathing image in his flesh
A revelation upon which you linger

His words are flies
Swarming towards the true insects
Feasting on buried dreams
And spreading decay upon your skin
His eyes spew forth a darkness
That cut through and paralyze
Casts light upon your secrets
Forced to confront your enemies

His mouth is a vortex
Sucking you into it's pandemonium
Fools you with a helping hand of ashes
Reached out in false dismay
His body is a country
The cities lay dead and beyond despair
Friends turned enemies unable to come clean
In a rising fog of reeking death

Everything you believed is a lie
Everyone you loved is a death burden
So you take comfort in him
And you are receptive to stark wishes
No longer struggling to declare your stand
You would inflict no harm to others
They are unaware of you
And in a loop of futile events
You are everything, they are nothing

Drown in the deep mire
With past desires
Beneath the mire
Drown desire now with you

Lined up verses on dead skin
"The tainted lips of the stranger
Resting upon hers"

And I embrace bereavement
Everything beloved is shattered anyway
I would devote myself to anyone
I would accept any flaws

I am too weak to resist
Tension vibrating with horror
Finding the outcast in my eyes
Pushing nerves on a puppet
Endless poison in my veins
Clean intent now tainted with death

And so, cold touch now inhumane
Every waking hour
Awaiting a reverie to unfold
And now they are calling me
Louder by the minute
The baying of the hounds
Calling me back to my home

<|endoftext|>

"Beneath The Mire"

Haunted nights for halcyon days
Can't sleep to the scraping of his voice
Nature's way struck grief in me
And I became a ghost in sickness

Willingly guided into heresy
Beneath the surface, stark emptiness
And you'd pity my conviction
Whereas I thought of myself as a leader

You'd cling to your pleasant hope
It is twisted fascination
While I'd ruin the obstacles into despair
And I'm praising death

Lost love of the heart
In a holocaust scene memory

Decrepit body wearing transparent skin
Inside, the smoke of failure

Wept for solace and submit to faith
In his shadow I'm choking
Yet flourishing

Master

A delusion made me stronger
Yet I'm draped in pale withering flesh
I sacrificed more than I had
And left my woes beneath the mire

<|endoftext|>

"Atonement"

Cleared the fog that was veiled around me
And blurred my sights
Suddenly, I'm no longer aching
To honor my plights

Rising moon and my skin is peeling
Past undone
Suddenly, I can't justify
What I had become

<|endoftext|>

"Reverie / Harlequin Forest"

Into the trees
Past meadow grounds
And further away from my home
Baying behind me
I hear the hounds
Flock's chasing to find me alone

A trail of sickness
Leading to me
If I am haunted
Then you will see

Searching the darkness
And emptiness
I'm hiding away from the sun
Will never rest
Will never be at ease
All my matter's expired so I run

There falls another
Vapor hands released the blade
Insane regrets at the drop
Instruments of death before me

Lose all to save a little
At your peril it's justified
And dismiss your demons
As death becomes a jest
You are the laughing stock
Of the absinthe minded
Confessions stuck in your mouth
And long gone fevers reappear

Nocturnally helpless
And weak in the light
Depending on a prayer
Pacing deserted roads to find
A seed of hope

They are the trees
Rotten pulp inside and never well
Roots sucking, thieving from my source
Tired boughs reaching for the light

It is all false pretension
Harlequin forest
Awaiting redemption for a lifetime
As they die alone
With no one by their side
Are they forgiven?

Stark determination
Poisoning the soul
Unfettered beast inside
Claiming sovereign control

And now the woods are burning
Tearing life crops asunder
Useless blackened remains
Still pyre smoldering

<|endoftext|>

"Hours Of Wealth"

Found a way to rid myself clean of pain
And the fever that's been haunting me
Has gone away

Looking through my window
I seem to recognize
All the people passing by
But I am alone
And far from home
And nobody knows me

Never heard me say goodbye
Never shall I speak to anyone again
All days are in darkness
And I'm biding my time
Once I am sure of my task I will rise again

"The Grand Conjuration"

Majesty
Faithful me
Pour yourself
Into me

Wield your power
Martyr's price
Stare me down
To the ground

The eyes of the devil
Fixed on his sinners

Slake my thirst
Eternal wealth
Heathen key
Round my neck

This poetry
Our blasphemy
Know the sounds
Of infamy

The hands of Satan
Assembling his flock
Pale horse rider
Scorching the earth

Whispered conjuration
A belief takes form
Choking hand tapping
The veins in your throat

His orders in your mouth
A decree for domination
Beneath the tides of wisdom
Spins the undertow of hate

Injected seeds of vengeance
Usurper's eyes of the powerless
Clean path to his kingdom
Beckoning in the mist

(The grand conjuration)

Tell me why
Love subsides
In the light
Of your wishes

Say my name
Ease the pain
Clear the smoke
In my head

"Isolation Years"

There's a sense of longing in me
As I read Rosemary's letter
Her writing's honest
Can't forget the years she's lost

In isolation
She talks about her love
And as I read
"I'll die alone"
I know she was aching

There's a certain detail seen here
The pen must have slipped to the side
And left a stain
Next to his name
She knows he's gone

And isolation
Is all that would remain
"The wound in me is pouring out
To rest on a lover's shore"

<|endoftext|>

"Soldier Of Fortune"

[Deep Purple cover]

I have often told you stories
About the way
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand
And sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me love me
And I would surely stay
But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune
Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old
When nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here
Now I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune
Yes, I can hear the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

"Windowpane"

Blank face in the windowpane
Made clear in seconds of light
Disappears and returns again
Counting hours, searching the night

Might be waiting for someone
Might be there for us to see
Might be in need of talking
Might be staring directly at me

Inside plays a lullaby
Slurred voice over children cries
On the inside

Haunting loneliness in the eye
Skin covering a secret scar
His hand is waving a goodbye
There's no response or action returned

There is deep prejudice in me
Outshines all reason inside
Given dreams all ridden with pain
And projected unto the last

<|endoftext|>

"In My Time Of Need"

I can't see the meaning of this life I'm leading
I try to forget you as you forgot me
This time there is nothing left for you to take, this is goodbye

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away

Close to ending it all, I am drifting through the stages
Of the rapture born within this loss
Thoughts of death inside, tear me apart from the core of my soul

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away

At times the dark's fading slowly
But it never sustains
Would someone watch over me
In my time of need

<|endoftext|>

"Death Whispered A Lullaby"

Out on the road there are fireflies circling
Deep in the woods, where the lost souls hide
Over the hill there are men returning
Trying to find some peace of mind

Sleep my child

Under the fog there are shadows moving
Don't be afraid, hold my hand
Into the dark there are eyelids closing
Buried alive in the shifting sands

Sleep my child

Speak to me now and the world will crumble
Open a door and the moon will fall
All of your life, all your memories
Go to your dreams, forget it all

Sleep my child

<|endoftext|>

"Closure"

Heal myself-a feather on my heart
Look inside-there never was a start
Peel myself-dispose of severed skin
All subsides-around me and within

There's nothing painful in this
There's no upheaval
Redemption for my pathos
All sins undone

Awaiting word on what's to come
In helpless prayers a hope lives on
As I've come clean I've forgotten what I promised
In the rays of the sun I am longing for the darkness

<|endoftext|>

"Hope Leaves"

In the corner beside my window
There hangs a lonely photograph
There is no reason
I'd never notice
A memory that could hold me back

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place

Gone through days without talking
There is a comfort in silence
So used to losing all ambition
Struggling to maintain what's left

Once undone, there is only smoke
Burning in my eyes to blind
To cover up what really happened
Force the darkness unto me

<|endoftext|>

"To Rid The Disease"

There's nobody here, there's nobody near
I try not to care, dead eyes always stare
Let these matters be, don't trust what you see
Take hold of your time, step into the line

There's innocence torn from its maker
Stillborn the trust in you
This failure has made the creator
So would you tell him what to do (would you)

Leave your mark upon the head of someone
Who'll cry for his state, we know it's too late
I turn round to see what was meant to be
Faint movement release to rid the disease

There's innocence torn from its maker
Stillborn the trust in you
(I have lost all trust I had in you)
This failure has made the creator
So would you tell him what to do
(I have lost all trust I had in you)

<|endoftext|>

"Weakness"

Found you there in the blink of an eye
(I) miss you
Turned away into a thousand dreams
Found out what they mean

Lost you there in a moment of truth
(I) trust you
Gave away the one and only heart
(A) gift to tear apart

Stain me, save me
Take me to my home
Hold me, show me
Take me to my home

Weaker now, drawing fluid from me
(You) kill me
I'm not afraid of what you have just done
(But of) what you've just become

<|endoftext|>

"Wreath"

Falling inside again
This nightmare always the same
Still never enough
Halting at the brink of discovery

Moving into the darkness
Leaking inside to cover up
Dragging me down and under
Entangled and undone at once

Old memories
I'm not in need but wish to know
What are the tragedies
The history behind the walls

Pacing further down
Familiar children's laughter
Dissonant and out of time
And their eyes are dead

Watching myself in a pool of water
Wearing the mask of a ghost
Smeared all across my skin
Rotten earth and insects

Endless night
Always preserving the calm
Movement behind

Bleeding animals in a field of fire
There is no absolution
Death is but a fairytale
They are mere visions
They are afraid of me

Clear insight
A smoke is rising nearby
Dust covering my coat
Blend together to spell my name

Pale, covered me with sweat
There are no words left
Sole provider of death
Distorted faith in myself

Human harvest burning
Blackest pages turning
Twisted perception come true
Captured in dreams connected

Staring right back
Spiritual decay - Still seeking
Frozen in time
Mourn this departure - All watching

Calling me back
Closure to bleak matters - I'm leaving
End of a search
Coming of morning

Calling me back
Closure to bleak matters - I'm leaving
End of a search
Coming of morning - Returning

"Deliverance"

Floating on mist
Crept up the caverns of my brain
Received no warning
From nothing to a life code
Walk with me, you'll never leave
Wait to see your spirit free
Tell me how your heart's in need
As I drown you in the sea
Unwinding snares of distrust
Your wrist in my fast grip
Look me in the eye, I'm clear
This is your time
Face down beneath the waterline
Gazing into the deep
From love to death
In a time span of seconds
Oblivious to regret
Pushed into belief
In liquid cellophane
Gasping for air
Mercy in my eyes
Is the shade of the night
The piercing sounds you make
Soaring higher, higher now
And once left in my wake
Your memory is nothing but the scars on me
All over now
Forgotten why I needed this
Standing down
Disappear into the obscure
Resting days
Waiting for new disease
Biding time
Locked inside insanity
It always burns within
The downward spiral never ends
When driven into sin
Your salvation's found in a sinner's deed
The devil guides the way
Tells me what to say
Pours himself inside
And snuffs the final light

Deliverance
Thrown back at me

Deliverance
Laughing at me

"A Fair Judgement"

Losing sleep, in too deep
Fading sun, what have I done
Came so close to what I need most
Nothing left here
Cut the ties, uncover disguise
Left behind all intertwined
Lost control, moved out of the role now
Nothing's left here
Leave it be
It was meant for me
Soul sacrifice
Forgot the advice
Lost track of time
In a flurry of smoke
Waiting anxiety
For a fair judgement deserved

<|endoftext|>

"Master's Apprentices"

There is a voice calling for me
There is a light coming down on me
There is a doubt that is clearing
There is a day that is dawning
There is a wound that is healing
There is a season waiting for me
There is a road that is turning
There is a fire still burning
A sickness in me
Constant pace towards the end
The need is stronger
This time the need is deeper

There is a peace I am searching
There is a freedom I'm depending on
There is a pain that's never ending
There is a rain falling only on me
There is a dream I am living
There is a life I am dreaming of
There is a death I'm awaiting
There is a home I am deserting

I hold my breath and wait
Only moments remain
Movement for departed hope
Effect for absent friend

Sever the faith from my body
Leave me begging for more
Take what I have and deliver me
Into everlasting sleep

Soothing trance
Colours fade
And disappear
Ethereal light
Showing me what I can do without

In a motionless scenes
There is only me
I take what I can
Controlling you to get ahead

Fading away
And leaving
Long for sleep
Closer now
Lead the way into death

Every wretched dream
I have left behind
Every waking hour
I lie in wait
Sucked inside by will
Gone into the flood
All my questions unfurled
As I was put to the test

Once I'm below there's no turning back

Every wretched dream
I have left behind
Every waking hour
I lie in wait

Plunging into the deepest void
Departed shell left drained behind

Pacing roads unknown
Searching for a new home
Desert in my eye
Barren lands inside

"By The Pain I See In Others"

Let me taste
Let me feel
I need to know what you keep inside
No need to speak
Just let it be
Carry out this wish for me let nothing interfere
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
Discard your clothes
Let loose you hair
We're intertwined forever and have always been
Say the word
And I'll depart
Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil

And so comes the dark
Vibrant as ever before
Flowers already withered
In this endless winter of souls
Outside in the park
The days move along
And nothing ever changes
They have nothing on us
And we've always knew
That nothing ever changes
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside
Depending on the life blood

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside

Silently
Whispering
Move in me and set me free

"The Leper Affinity"

We entered Winter once again
Naked, freezing from my breath
Neath the lid all limbs tucked away
This coffin is your abode from now and onwards

Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears

I am beyond death
Midst a dreaming affinity
Saving strength now, faint whispers
Come erotic communion in its splendour

Fever mirrored ghosts
Night time consolation, cross the line
Draw murder into art
Sleep inside through days

In the wake of this relief
Shivering, longing for more
Insanity at it's peak
Love me to my death

Lost are days of Spring
You sighted and let me in
Keep the beast inside
Shackled within my hide
Screaming out too late
Losing to my hate
Grew together with your skin
And paced the trails of sin

Your gaze covered with virgin snow
Rigid features
It's the shallow deeds who is to blame
Deafening shrieks pierced the night

A step from oblivion
Moving into the dim lights
Hiding within a reverie
It was worth it for the wait alone

Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears

<|endoftext|>

"Bleak"

Beating
Heart still beating for the cause
Feeding
Soul still feeding from the loss
Aching
Limbs are aching from the rush
Fading
You are fading from my sight
Break of morning, coldness lingers on
Shroud me into nightmares of the sun

Moving
I am moving closer to your side
Luring
You are luring me into the night
Crying
Who is crying for you here
Dying
I am dying fast inside your tears

Plunging towards bereavement faster yet
Clearing thoughts, my mind is set

Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me
You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away
Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine

Help me cure you
Atone for all you've done
Help me leave you
As all the days are gone

Devious movements...

(Night falls again
Taking what's left of me!)

Slight twist, shivering corpse
Ornated with water, fills the cracks
Clasped in my limbs by tradition
This is all you need

<|endoftext|>

"Harvest"

Stay with me awhile
Rise above the vile
Name my final rest
Poured into my chest

Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death, all I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr

Pledge yourself to me
Never leave me be
Sweat breaks on my brow
Given time ends now

Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death, all I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr

Spirit painted sin
Embers neath my skin
Veiled in pale embrace
Reached and touched my face

Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
(Release your grip, let me go, into the night)
Halo of death, All I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr

"The Drapery Falls"

Please remedy my confusion
And thrust me back to the day
The silence of your seclusion
Brings night into all you say

Pull me down again
And guide me into pain

I'm counting nocturnal hours
Drowned visions in haunted sleep
Faint flickering of your powers
Leaks out to show what you keep

Pull me down again
And guide me into

There is failure inside
This test I can't persist
Kept back by the enigma
No criteria is demanded here
Deadly patterns made my wreath
Prosperous in your ways
Pale ghost in the corner
Pouring a caress on your shoulder

Puzzled by shrewd innocence
Runs a thick tide beneath
Ushered into inner graves
Nails bleeding from the struggle
It is the end for the weak at heart
Always the same
A lullaby for the ones who've lost all
Reeling inside
My gleaming eye in your necklace reflects
Stare of primal regrets
You turn your back and you walk away
Never again

Spiraling to the ground below
Like Autumn leaves left in the wake to fade away
Waking up to your sound again
And lapse into the ways of misery

<|endoftext|>

"Dirge For November"

Lost, here is nowhere
Searching home still
Turning past me, all are gone
Time is now

The omen showed, took me away
Preparations are done, this can't last
The mere reflection brought disgust
No ordeal to conquer, this firm slit
It sheds upon the floor, dripping into a pool
Grant me sleep, take me under
Like the wings of a dove, folding around
I fade into this tender care

<|endoftext|>

"The Funeral Portrait"

You wait by the window
Morning's breath on the sill
Idle hands given another try
So you wait and you savour the moment
Outside the canvas turned white
Ruby eyes in the fog

Rain washing clean all the sins
A liquid gown that covers all
Your loathe turns endless
Opened mirage soothes your sense
Locked on the pinnacle
The best secret within

Like a derelict child
Heart burning for a stranger
Ascending to the meek
Flock round the liars in awe

Caked in the soil beneath
Fear me when we meet
Turn away in admiration
My firm grip round the nucleus of joy

Enough of this
You will leave me now
You will see it now
Perish at my hands

Close to you
Tangled up in hair
Fresh stigma looks
Shall I take you with me
And it is cold
Ruby eyes in the fog
It is me

And you are just like them all
Stained by the names of fathers
I'm greeting my downward fall
Leaving the throes to others

"Blackwater Park"

Confessor
Of the tragedies in man
Lurking in the core of us all
The last dying call for the ever lost
Brief encounters, bleeding pain

Lepers coiled neath the trees
Dying men in bewildered soliloquies
Perversions bloom round the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic under the waning moon

It is the year of death
Wielding his instruments
Stealth sovereign reaper
Touching us with ease

Infecting the roots in an instant
Burning crop of disease
I am just a spectator
An advocate documenting the loss
Fluttering with conceit
This doesn't concern me yet
Still far from the knell
Taunting their bereavement

Mob round the dead
Point fingers at the details
Probing vomits for more
Caught in unbridled suspense

We have all lost it now
Catching the flakes of dismay
Born the travesty of man
Regular pulse midst pandemonium
You're plucked to the mass
Parched with thirst for the wicked

Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark
The sun sets forever over Blackwater Park

<|endoftext|>

"Still Day Beneath The Sun"

There is a light that hits the gloom around
Shows the footprints round this grave
Dried up roses scattered on the mound
Honouring the one engraved

Will ever the morning
Carry away
The souls of those for whom we cry

Leaving, grieving
Seeking, meeting
Binding, unwinding
Sighing, "you"

Still day beneath the sun
Asking you who is the one
And when the day is late
We know who must forever wait

Black procession through the narrow aisles
Another's gone for all to see
Near the site for one who lost his trials
Sleeping neath the ground is me

"Patterns In The Ivy 2"

Without you I cannot confide in anything
The hope is pale designed in light of dreams you bring
Summer's gone, the day is done soon comes the night
Biding time, leaving the line and out of sight

One moonlit shadow on the wall
Disrupted in its own creation
Veiled in the darkness of this fall
Is this the end-manifestation

It runs in me, your poison seething in my veins
This skin is old and stained by late September rains
A final word from me would be the first for you
The rest is long but I'll go on inside and through

One moonlit shadow on the wall
Disrupted in its own creation
Veiled in the darkness of this fall
Is this the end-manifestation

Patterns in the Ivy
Patterns in the Ivy

"The Moor"

The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays

Weary from what might have been ages
Still calm with my mind at peace
Would I prosper or fall, drain the past
The lapse of the moment took it's turn

I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death-mask at birth
The hands of God, decrepit and thin
Cold caress and then nothing
I was taken away from my plight
A treason bestowed to the crowd
Branded a Jonah with fevered blood
Ungodly freak, defiler

Pale touch, writhing in the embers
Damp mud burning in my eyes
All the faces turned away
And all would sneer at my demise

Outcast with dogmas forged below
Seared and beaten, banished from where I was born
No mercy would help me on my way
In the pouring rain nothing is the same

Vows in ashes
I pledge myself to no-one
Seethed and spiteful
All shudder at the call of my name
If you'll bear with me
You'll fear of me

There is no forgiveness in these eyes
For any of you but one
Dispel the mist for now
Melinda is the reason why I've come

She is water drops over the pyre
A thistle in my hands
Stained and torn, aged and brown
Virtuous shell with kindred innocence

I awoke from the miasma
Passing swiftly through the moor
This is here, waters stir
And in the distance all that was lost
If you'll bear with me
You'll fear of me
You'd never leave me to
A fate with you

"Godhead's Lament"

Marauder
Staining the soil, midst of stillness
Beloved fraternity to an end
Red eyes probe the scene
All the same
Stilted for the beholder
Depravity from the core
Handcarved death in stoneladen aisles

I hide the scars from my past
Yet they sense my (mute) dirge
This is when it all falls apart
White hands grasping for straws

Sly smile, poisoned glare behind
Undisguised manmade nova
Mute cry, don't dare to tread
Searing beams tracking you down

Adoring what never has been
Some will bring with them all they have seen

Searching my way to perplexion
The gleam of her eyes
In that moment she knew

Thought I could not leave this place
On this imminent day
As I've reached the final dawn
To what's gone astray
What would they care if I did stay
No-one would know
What would they care if I did stay
No-one should know

Thought I could not leave this place
On this imminent day
As I've reached the final dawn
To what's gone astray
What would they care if I did stay
No-one would know
What would they care if I did stay
No-one should know

Still brooding, soothing calm
That rigid, twisted face
Blank godhead, tear my name
Lost virtue, frantic lust

Sly smile, poisoned glare behind
Undisguised manmade nova
Mute cry, don't dare to tread
Searing beams tracking you down

Adoring what never has been
Some will bring with them all they have seen

Searching my way to perplexion
In crumbling faith I saw her
Bearing her pain in the wilderness
The gleam of her eyes
In that moment she knew

<|endoftext|>

"Benighted"

Come into this night
Here we'll be gone
So far away
From our weak and crumbling lives
Come into this night
When days are done
Lost and astray
In what's vanished from your eyes

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright

Come into this night
Your plight alone
Carry your weight
You are flawed as all of us
Come into this night
Your only home
It's never too late
To repent, suffer the loss

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright

Come into this night
When you're able
To undo your deeds
And atone with your lonely soul
Once you're into this night
All minds are stable
Forget all your needs
Lose the grip of all control

<|endoftext|>

"Moonlapse Vertigo"

Kept warm by the light of the lantern
Lost sight of everything tonight
My presence blackens their pattern
A pock in the healthy and calm

Their scorn behind your back
My promise would put them down
No trace of reverence left
Immemorial fire in their eyes

I would perish at the given signal
At the slightest touch from my soul
Tainted prophet in flesh
For all the plagued and lost

Dripping sin
Decision in stalemate
Dare to feel death at hand
Surprised me with its voice
Through the forest came the morn

Across the leafy pathway
Their deeds smeared in blood
For all to behold
The council of the cross
Must have sensed my coming
The pest through the air
With despise for squalor
Lashing out at the poor

I turned away my eyes
In pallor escape from the end
Fading time to leave from here
And less to fulfill my task
She would be safe and firm
Nothing of this is in vain
Taken away from stifling grace
And saved from the past

<|endoftext|>

"Face Of Melinda"

By the turnstile beckons a damsel fair
The face of Melinda neath blackened hair
No joy would flicker in her eyes
Brooding sadness came to a rise

Words would falter to atone
Failure had passed the stepping stone
She had sworn her vows to another
This is when no-one will bother

And conceded pain in crumbling mirth
A harlot of God upon the earth
Found where she sacrificed her ways
That hollow love in her face

Still I plotted to have her back
The contentment that would fill the crack
My soul released a fluttering sigh
This day fell, the darkness nigh

I took her by the hand to say
All faith forever has been washed away
I returned for you in great dismay
Come with me, far away to stay

Endlessly gazing in nocturnal prime
She spoke of her vices and broke the rhyme
But baffled herself with the final line
My promise is made but my heart is thine

<|endoftext|>

"Serenity Painted Death"

Returned from a hibernal dream
Voices fell like marble
No longer by my side
Gone all that would linger

Ripped from my embrace
Melinda reflected in shafts
Red line round her neck
Met the earth in silence

Pale

White faced, haggard grin
This serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath

White faced, haggard grin
This serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath

Saw her fading, blank stare into me
Clenched fist from the beautiful pain

Darkness reared its head
Tearing within the reeling haze
Took control, claiming my flesh
Piercing rage, perfect tantrum
Each and every one would die at my hand
Choking in warm ponds of blood
At last, weak and torn, I went down
Drained from strength, flickering breath

Came with the moon
The wayward in conscious state
Flanked and barred in destiny's end
Underneath with hope in latches
Swathed in filth, any would betoken
Starlit shadows on the wall
Finally there to collect me
From the bowels of sin

<|endoftext|>

"White Cluster"

Still it came passing by
The pieces weaved together rose the sun
And fooled me with another day
The knocking message called for my life

Sealed the spell of my scrawny body
Soil to skin, my next of kin
Damp air grasped, stole the words
And greeted me with a hiss

This is forgiveness, so I know
Once I repent I seal the lid
I slither for you and I'm dying
I find trust in hate

They wear white for me
Seemingly jaded and lost
I forge myself into your dreams
And here I am your life

Hangman, clutching at his tools
I will come for you

The noose is tied
Murmur through the crowd
Plunging into anywhere but here

Cloak-captured sighs of relief
As the primal touch brought me back
And the last sight I did see is still here
Beckoning right behind me

<|endoftext|>

"Prologue"

[Instrumental]

A morning in magenta, the petals fed from the dew.
She held her breath for a moment, to pause off the stream.
Still clinging to vast, old memories.
And I would marvel at her beauty, playing through the rain.
The coffin is beautifully engraved.
Stained by soil, symbols of death.
All of which are stared upon, with porcelain eyes it seems.
Some spoke, and it was my turn to go.
In death entwined, I could not believe.
But it hangs around my neck.
A soft breeze passed me by, somewhat warmer for a second.
I knew it was the coming of spring, thus our APRIL ETHEREAL.

<|endoftext|>

"April Ethereal"

It was me, peering through the looking-glass.
Beyond the embrace of Christ.
Like the secret face within the tapestry.
Like a bird of prey over the crest.
And she was swathed in sorrow, as if born within its mask.

Her candlelight snuffed, the icon smiled.
Emptiness followed by her wake.
I could clasp her in undying love.
Within ghostlike rapture the final word was mine.

She faced me in awe. 'twas a token of ebony colour.
Embodied in faint vapour.
Wandering through April's fire.
Compelled to grasp and to hold the one that was you.

I will endure, hide away.
I would outrun the scythe, glaring with failure.

It is a mere destiny I thought, a threshold I had crossed before.
The rain was waving goodbye, and when the night came
the forest folded its branches around me.
Something passed by, and I went into a dream.
She laughing and weeping at once: "take me away".

I don't know how or why, I'll never know WHEN.

<|endoftext|>

"When"

Red sun rising somewhere through the dense fog.
The portrait of the jaded dawn who had seen it all before.

This day wept on my shoulders.
Still the same as yesterday.
This path seems endless, body is numb.
The soul has lost its flame.
Walking in familiar traces to find my way back home.

So there I was.
Within the sobriety of the immortals.
A semblance of supernatural winds passing through.
The garden sighs, flowers die.

The gate was closed that day, but I was bound to carry on.
She could not see me through the windows.
In dismay, strangest twist upon her lips.
Graven face, she said my name.

Once inside I heard whispers in the parlour.
The gilded faces grin, aware of my final demise.

And I cried, I knew she had lied.
Her obsession had died, it had died.

When can I take you from this place?
When is the word but a sigh?
When is death our lone beholder?
When do we walk the final steps?
When can we scream instead of whisper?

When is the new beginning,
the end of this sad MADRIGAL.

<|endoftext|>

"Madrigal"

[Instrumental]

Our abode 'mongst the stars is waiting,
long enough for our last breath of life.
You stare at nothing, right through me,
at times resembling the Devil's concubine.
And me, I am the idol that would long
to caress our eyes until they would open no more.
I would comfort you if I only could,
but as we all know by now... I am just thin air.
Unaware as you are of my presence,
you are losing yourself.
Hiding within THE AMEN CORNER.

<|endoftext|>

"The Amen Corner"

White summer.
So far I have gone to see you again.
Hiding your face in the palm of your hands.
Finding solace in the words I do despise.

You snatch at every sound.
And even though you believe that I am shackled within death,
memories are tainted with paleness.
Crestfallen still.
Those eyes... empty like a barren well.

It was the only task I would undertake.
To reap the harvest that was mine.
The seed that had sprung into a florid meadow,
and left me helpless in your embrace.
The bond we never spoke of, once stark and enticing,
now slowly smoldering to dust.

The celestial touch, from grey to black.
A fathomless void enclosing.
Unwritten secrets beneath the cobwebs.
I can not endure.

And so I rose from my sleep.
The moon turned away its face.
Overture of the long, black night begins...
something you said: "Eerie circles upon the waters".

Until now we have shared the same aura.
My ashes within your hands.

My breath in the sepulchral mound.
You know that your night is my day.
The final spark that blew life into me,
the DEMON OF THE FALL.

<|endoftext|>

"Demon Of The Fall"

Silent dance with death.
Everything is lost.
Torn by the arrival of Autumn.
The blink of an eye, you know it's me
You keep the dagger close at hand.

And you saw nothing.
False love turned to pure hate.
The wind cried a lamentation
before merging with the grey.

Demon of the fall.

Gasping for another breath.
She rose, screaming at closed doors.
Seductive faint mist forging
through the cracks in the wall.

I shant resist.
In tears for all of eternity.
She turned around and faced me for the first time.

Run away, run away.
Just one second, and I was left with nothing.
Her fragrance still pulsating through damp air.
That day came to an end.

And she had lost in me, her CREDENCE.

<|endoftext|>

"Credence"

Deserted again.
You speak to me through the shadows.
Walking in closed rooms, using cold words.
Captured by the night.
The yearning escapes from my embrace.

Strange silhouettes whisper your thoughts, scream your sadness.
And they all turned away,
unable to face more of this death.

Credence in my word.
Written in dust, tainted by memories.
I confess my hope, recognize my loneliness.

Your laughter weeps the truth.
Push me into corners.
Confirming the epitaph of my soul
and displaying the once unknown KARMA.

<|endoftext|>

"Karma"

And as they say, grief is only able to possess.
The rotting body clad in ancient clothes
is left behind with a wave of the hand.

I have gone away. The bed is cold and empty.
Trees bend their boughs toward the earth.
And nighttime birds float as black faces.

It was the hand reaching out through the mirror.
Unknown and scarred by life...
the luring eyes, you had never seen.

You have nothing more to find.
You have nothing more to lose.

The cold season drifts over the land.
They huddle in the brown corners.

Some would settle for less.
The castles were all empty, asleep.
Long awaiting their king.
Beckoning round the bend.

Amidst the forest one would hear that I had been there.
Draped within a fate I could not change,
and always welcoming Winter's EPILOGUE.

<|endoftext|>

"Epilogue"

[Instrumental]

There it was.
The final destiny.
A sunrise that never came,
still the night lamp that never faded away.
Farewell was the word,
and the afterglow was the brave morning.
Rising and telling everyone
about the beauty of its PROLOGUE.

<|endoftext|>

"Circle Of The Tyrants"

[Celtic Frost cover]

After the battle is over
And the sands drunken the blood
All what there remains
Is the bitterness of delusion

The immortality of the gods
Sits at their side
As they leave the walls behind
To reach the jewels gleam

The days have come
When the steel will rule
And upon his head
A crown of gold

Your hand wields the might
The tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will
As the morning is near

I sing the ballads
Of victory and defeat
I hear the tales
Of frozen mystery

The new kingdoms rise
By the circle of the tyrants
In the land of darkness
The warrior, that was me
Grotesque glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and war
Are like everlasting shadows

Where the winds cannot reach
The tyrant's might was born
And often I look back
With tears in my eyes
Grotesque glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and wars

<|endoftext|>

"Remember Tomorrow"

[Iron Maiden cover]

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of the fire.

Tears for rememberance, and tears for joy,
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of the fire.

<|endoftext|>

"Advent"

It was all true
A parlour strode, and the night sets forever
I stray in the quiet cold
And you gird me when I dare to listen

Elastic meadow, endless arms of sorrow
Lips try to form "because"
Trying to adapt to the wilderness
Where even foes close their eyes and leave

We are inside the glade
Every now and then I wipe the dust aside
To remember...

How I drape my face with my bare hands
The same that brought me here
But you were beyond all help
The folded message that wept my name

Shadows skulk at my coming
We survey the slopes
In search for the words to write the missing page
The tainted dogma

Time grows short
As the piper plays his tune
We are almost there

You are beyond all help
Dancing into the void
We are almost there

<|endoftext|>

"The Night And The Silent Water"

And so you left us
Jaded and gaunt, some September
Wilted with the seasons
But hidden inside the delusion
I saw your eyes somewhere

Devoid of death
The aura poises amidst (the storm)
In solid tears I linger
A parlour glade, moonlit sorrow

Lonely resting pools
Relics of the moon-dogged lake
Whisper, "All your words are misgiven."

Am I like them?
Those who mourn and turn away
Those who would give anything
To see you again
If only for another second

Your face was, like the photograph
Painted white
We did not speak very often about it
What does it matter now?

Cloak of autumn shroud
I gaze, dim ricochet of stars
I reckon it is time for me to leave

You sleep in the light
Yet the night and the silent water
Still so dark

<|endoftext|>

"Nectar"

I arose from the lullaby
Enduring yet another tale
You tempt me again
With your embrace, so tainted
Within the night you beckon
Cursing me with every glance

Bring me through
Carry my empty shadow
And guide me inside your warped labyrinth
To the well of sin
I swear I will always love you

Leave me speechless
Release my yearning
The soil I walk is clad with light
Drifting moons thrust me with their rays
And I fall inside

I lament this heritage
Cannot bid farewell
The pale face...you went as far as you could
And from that moment
I witnessed your beauty, felt your death

Mine is yours, mine is yours

In the wake of dawn
The mist of morning linger before it leaves
Invisible eyes, red reflection
It is you
Smiling in the midst of the moor

<|endoftext|>

"Black Rose Immortal"

In the name of desperation
I call your name
A lamentation I sigh
Again and again

Spiritual eclipse
The gateways are closed for me to seek

The night...
A veil of stars, watching
My shadow is born from light
The light of the eye, in darkness

Over troubled waters memories soar
Endlessly, searching night and day
The moonlight caresses a lonely hill
With the calmness of a whisper

I wear a naked soul
A blank face in the streaming water
It is cold in here
Frost scar my coat with dust

Eyes attach to your mute portrait
We spoke only through thoughts
Together we gazed, awaited
Hours brought thirst and the rising sun

Sunbirds leave their dark recesses
Shadows glide the archways

Do not turn your face towards me
Confronting me with my loneliness
You are in a forest unknown
The secret orchard
And your voice is vast and achromatic
But still so precious

Lullaby of the crescent moon took you
Mesmerized, its kaleidoscopic face
Granted you a hollow stare
Another soul within the divine herd

I have kept it
The Amaranth symbol
Hiddin inside the golden shrine
Until we rejoice in the meadow
Of the end
When we both walk the shadows
It will set ablaze and vanish
Black rose immortal

It is getting dark again
Dusk shuffle across the fields
The evening trees moan as if they knew
At night I always dream of you

<|endoftext|>

"To Bid You Farewell"

I am awaiting the sunrise
Gazing modestly through the coldest morning
Once it came you lied
Embracing us over autumn's proud treetops

I stand motionless
In a parade of falling rain
Your voice I cannot hear
As I am falling again

Devotion eludes
And in sadness I lumber
In my own ashes I am standing without a soul
She wept and whispered: "I know..."

We walked into the night
Am I to bid you farewell?

Why can't you see that I try
When every tear I shed
Is for you?

<|endoftext|>

"Eternal Soul Torture"

[2000 re-issue bonus track]

The deceased awake from beyond their sleep.
Search for blood and mortal meat.
Maggots crawl out from their eyes.
Feel their pain, it's mournful cries.
Pull your veins, tear out your heart.
Consume the blood, feast on flesh.
Torn apart, intestines scattered.
Alimentary canal ripped and shattered.
Pieces of your body eaten.
Painful death as time stands still.
Where your mind bursts in torture.
Feel your soul be torn apart.
Demons crawling through your system.
Hell has risen, the gods of pain.
Rip your skin, burn your bones.
Internal organs torn and drained.
Smell of flesh burnt to ashes.
Cries of death from hell.
Pain is all you revolve around.
Where the souls of Satan's grounds.
Rooms of eternal torture, reveal endurance of endless pain.
Disintegrating mortals, bodies burn.
There you feel the hellish torture.
Hellish torment, brutal butchering.
Demonic creatures revolve in torment...

<|endoftext|>

"In The Mist She Was Standing"

Seven milestones...
Under a watching autumn eye
Contorted trees are spreading forth
The message of the wind

With frozen hands I rode with the stars

With anger the wind blew
Giving wings to my stallion
Clouds gathered across the moon
Blazing the white light

Passing the lake I know so well
I am near, yet so far away

Arrival...
I saw her shadow (standing) in the darkness
Awaiting me like the night
Awaits the day
Standing silent smiling at my presence
A black candle holds the only light

Darkness encloses
And the candle seem to expire
In her cold, cold hand
And as a forlorn soul
It will fade away

Touching her flesh in this night
My blood froze forever
Embraced before the dawn
A kiss brought total eclipse

And she spoke
Once and forever
I am so cold
In mist enrobed the twilight
She was standing...

<|endoftext|>

"Under The Weeping Moon"

Once again I've cried
Unto the moon
That burning flame
That has guided me
Through all these years
The lake from which you flow

With eyes of fire
Once unlit but now alive
This energy, sparkling
Like a morning star

The morning star

Riding the fires of
The northern gold
I've searched the eye
I laugh under the weeping moon

I am the watcher in the skies
Nor the emeralds know my mark
Glisten to mark their presence
Set the enigma ablaze
Searching...
Finding...

Burn the winter landmarks
That said I was there
Burn the spirit of cold
That travel through my soul

<|endoftext|>

"The Forest Of October"

The memories that now rests in this forest
Forever shadowing the sunrise of my heart
Wings leave their nest at my coming
Swaying away unto the cold glowing sky
Dreaming away for a while
My spirit sighs in peace
Gazing unto the stars
Please, take me there

I am so alone, so cold
My heart is to scarred to glow
I wish the sunrise to come
Take my soul (away)
From this cold, lonely shell
I am free

From the eternal sea I rose
Veiled in darkness on either shore
Lost my pride, lost its glow
For me the sun rose no more

The forest of October
Sleeps silent when I depart
The web of time
Hides my last trace

My blaze travel the last universe
Like the sights of magic
Wrapped in aeons
My mind is one with my soul
I fall alone
While leaves fall from the weeping trees

<|endoftext|>

"The Twilight Is My Robe"

Unto you I whisper
The wildest dreams

In the coldness of night

Shrouded in crystals
Through a frosty dusk
Souls of the fullmoon awaits
Their shadows ablaze

We are all bending
Our tired leaves over your empty shell
In the sign of true esteem
Are you beloved lord
Sighing deep under these waterfalls?

The birds of the sun
Seperates these dark clouds
While the winds of winter sleeps gently around
I am sworn to the oath
To breathe...

At the waters I dwell
The waves are still whispering
Ancient lullabies
I die....
While our mystic brothers still seek

Under your command I will obey
In my vision
You are the embodiment of pure freedom
But through my eyes you are made of stone

<|endoftext|>

"The Apostle In Triumph"

In solitude I wander....
Through the vast enchanted forest
The surrounding skies are one
Torn apart by the phenomenon of lightning
Rain is pouring down my (now) shivering shoulders
In the rain my tears are forever lost

The darkened oaks are my only shelter
Red leaves are blown by the wind
An ebony raven now catches my eye
Sitting in calmness
Before spreading his black wings
Reaching for the skies

In this forest
Where wolves cry their agony unto the moon
My spirit is hidden
In the form of wisdom
carved on a black stone
The only way to follow

Open your soul
Redeem, I am immortal

Blinded by a light
My soul is held up in glory
I engulf the skies
The apostle in triumph

Through the eternal flame I travel
As the rain keeps falling....
