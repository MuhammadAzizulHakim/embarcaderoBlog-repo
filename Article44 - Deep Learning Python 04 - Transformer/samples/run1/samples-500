 as a symbol of my will
That they not only destroy me, but they also show their will in other ways
This runs contrary to what most people think

The arrogance of our leaders
In spite of their best efforts
Only a tyrant can make a difference

And I believe it's our destiny
To live up to our potential
So I've collected some of my own short stories from my life
How I survive to see where I stand

A walk in the woods, where the stars touch the sky
I'll catch a train, take a walk on the cloud, I feel fine
And I'll find I'm smarter than before

"The Whispered Passage"

Take my hand and I'll fly
Don't touch my phone
Don't touch my lease
Don't touch my car
Don't touch my sex

I can't believe I still walk the streets
I can't believe I still lived that way
If I don't get over

There are shadows upon the pavement
I've seen the writing on their skin
Until I get to where I belong
I'll never be open again

If I walk away from my mistakes
And I get through this hell without a doubt
If I live my life to the fullest
And I live my life so that I'm open with my soul
Then maybe I'll finally understand
But I'm not sure why I'm here

It's been a while
But I can't get used to the way
There are still vast areas of my life
That I'd like to get over

"Chrysalis"

[Chrysalis sitting in the room with the writing on his window]

It's a secluded corner of his shop
There's a vintage knife that he's been looking for
It shows the writing on his skin
It's the start of something new

The first step is already taken
Just step right into his shoes
Take your time, be patient
He won't take much walking with you

Don't be afraid to take the fall
Stay on your guard up here
It's got five steps by the stairs
You can practically take five steps right now
You can even take five o'clock on a hot Summer day

"The Glass Prison"

[Instrumental]

He really shouldn't be here
He's such a asshole
And heh heh heh
Not the first one to be so
emo
He even blew up his sister's wedding
And then she was all alone with no one to share

She's so fucking loud and so fucking cruel
And I'm sick of all of this bullshit
And I really shouldn't be here
Because I don't wanna be.

I don't wanna be a jerk, a bitch or a fucking asshole
And all this shit, I don't wanna have to deal with
Because I don't wanna be around anyone who isn't Meryl Streep

I've been through it before with the pictures
And I kinda like the acting because of all the dick pictures

I don't wanna be a stranger on the Web
And I don't wanna be afraid to be famous
And all this shit, I don't wanna have to deal with
Because I don't wanna be around anyone who isn't Meryl Streep

I wanna be loved... I wanna be celebrated...
And all this shit, I don't wanna have to deal with
Because I don't wanna be around anyone who isn't Meryl Streep

[Repeats in Congress:]
- Repeal and destroy
Repeal and destroy
Repeal and destroy this mess that's hurting you
Repeal and destroy your own unfettered free choice

Obamacare sucks... It sucks no more
Repeal and destroy your own unfettered free choice

The left is wrecking right with this
Obamacare sucks... It sucks no more
Repeal and destroy your own unfettered free choice

The right is wrecking
