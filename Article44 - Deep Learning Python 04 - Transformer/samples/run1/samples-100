 walked that night
I never wanted to die, don't look at it now
When you just hold it,
Don't look at it now
You will only have the right to die

"I Breathe"

As soon as I take the breath
And I'm sitting and sitting in my car
All the time I'll look inside and I won't be able to look
Out of my eyes I see all the sorrow
That I can't hide from, all the hate
that is hiding inside me
I'm not hiding from, I'm not hiding from, I'm hiding from
And I try not to let my anger linger
When it's gone
And the scars are white
And I can't shake
And my eyes are black
You know what I'm talking about

I want to fight so much
So I'm fighting, and fighting

"When I Breathe"

You just hold it
Keep my heart open

What's happened
Now I've lost you
I'm getting away
All the love I'm giving you
Suck in my mouth
Like the sun
And you're a monster
Now you'll be dead I know you well

When I breathe in and out and you're hiding
I'm sitting and sitting in my car
All the time I'll look inside and I won't be able to look out into the rain
I'm breathing in and out
All the anger
I see inside me
Burn, and I cry
I don't like to look

[End of song]

"When I Breathe"

I feel like I'm dying
And I breathe in and out like I'm dying

I just keep my heart open
And I wanna fight like a monster
When I breathe in and out and you're hiding
I'm sitting and sitting in my car
All the time I'll look inside and I won't be able to look inside
Out there, hiding behind the wheel
Trying my hand at work

[Stage 4]

I just keep my heart open
And I breathe in and out like I'm dying

I just keep my heart open
And I breathe in and out like I'm dying
Until my heart's empty
And I breathe in and out like I'm dying
Until I breathe in and out like I'm dying

And I breathe in and out like I'm dying
Until the heart's empty
And I breathe in and out like I'm dying

And I keep my heart open
And I breathe in and out like I'm dying
Until I breathe in and out
And I breathe in and out
and I breathe in and out
and I breathe in and out
and I breathe in and out
and I breathe in and out
and I breathe in and out
and I breathe in and out
And I keep my heart open
And I breathe in and out like I'm dying
Until my heart's empty
And I breathe in and out like I'm dying

And I breathe in and out like I'm dying
Until I breathe in and out
and I breathe in and out
and I breathe in and out
and I breathe in and out

And I breathe in and out
And I keep my heart open
And I don't know the reason
I'm just hiding in here
I'm just hiding from you

"The End"

You know the answer
But never the reason
And he won't admit
And never will admit
And never will admit

"I feel like I can't change this
The thought of losing you
Is just too much
To take out now."

"You are now, I can't leave you anymore."

"You won't be coming back
Until we get to know each other again."

"The end."

"So tell me how
How did our lives end here at home?"
"The idea of losing you somehow made us all better people."
"We are now, I can't leave you, I can't stay."

"So tell me how we got here here in this hellhole."
"We never wanted to stay here in this hellhole."
"I didn't want to be here in this hellhole!"

All you want to be here in
is getting into this hellhole."

"The Raven Is A Rope"

I saw her in the mirror
In the dark
She's a raven.
You'll never understand
How I got here here in this hellhole."


And she was sitting in the corner
Just standing there with her
Wanted me to go."
