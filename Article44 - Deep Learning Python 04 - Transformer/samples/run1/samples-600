've stuck all my pictures with you
On this floor
Or somewhere
You can take them and show me
The way things have always
Been changing

"Face In The Snow"

[I. Someone Like Him]

I have to confess, I'm really impressed with the way he approaches his tales. In short, I've never been so impressed.
He doesn't try to impress, he doesn't try to frighten, but he doesn't seem to think that he has the time
to display his finest.
The prose is simply breathtaking, and the prose is breathtaking
For a man whose work so often reflects our times.

To write about him, even when he's not there, is simply jaw-dropping. Not only is he one of the greatest storytellers of all time, he's one of the greatest at what he's doing
and his prose is simply jaw-dropping, but he's collected so well

His prose is simply jaw-dropping. Not only is he one of the greatest storytellers of all time, he's one of the greatest at what he's doing
And his prose is simply jaw-dropping

He's talked about a lot, but nothing seems to have been asaring as this for a while
Well I'm sorry if that stinks for you
But I'm doing better
I hope you're too
And I'm doing better than
I said I'd do

Until I'm perfectly content and
Controlling my life (and)
I'm not feeling very good
And I have to deal with this
I'm perfectly content
And I can't wait to tell you how
How I found I could control my life (and)
I'm content to let your past take you through
All this shit with me now

[II. REVELATION]

So many things have gone astray this past year
From the launching of Pioneer to his car
Pioneer had just gone into space
When he boarded the capsule he knew it was his last
He boarded an aging Dreamliner
and suddenly was dead

He boarded an aging Dreamliner and suddenly was dead

And reared his head and practically jumped
Tears my pride into two
She smiled at once, shaking his head
Tears my pride into two
She boarded an aging Dreamliner and suddenly was dead

"Flood"

Back in high school I idolized the cheerleaders
A choirboy's dream come true
Now they walk on eggshells
What they have become
Walk on eggshells will always remain

In the end, I gave them all my all
In a kind of supernatural way
This tells me that they will always love me

I guess I should lay claim
Gold star for her intelligence
Blue pill for her charity
Yellow crescent moon for our little war

Puzzled by accident
IimcannyBallsoplanetsperfectly
And distracted by boredom
I try to join the club
But he only sees me as a friend
So heposits: "How exactly do you feel about this?"
My answer: "Well, you'd be surprised"

"Flood"

[Mikael Akerfeldt]
My heart's desire swelled with doubt
As it had the day
As an infant
I wondered if we'd lost my heart
And carried a message of hope
That maybe at times we'd lost our way

I felt a chill in my senses
I wondered if I'd wandered into a place of ennui
And maybe I just wandered into a nightmare
And maybe it's not so bad
But still what'd you say?
I guess we'll always be one

In the end, I gave them all my all
In a kind of supernatural way
This tells me that they will always love me

I guess I should lay claim
Gold star for her intelligence
Blue pill for her charity
Yellow crescent moon for our little war

Puzzled by accident

And distracted by boredom
