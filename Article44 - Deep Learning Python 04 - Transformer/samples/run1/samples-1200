We feel like yesterday

The flashbulb moment
Three hundred volts on a current
Wanting to be out of there
Saving energy
But no-one's coming home

We feel like yesterday

The flashbulb moment
Three hundred volts on a current
Wanting to be out of there
Saving energy
But no-one's coming home

I feel like I'm out
But the clocks sound the same
And the message is now

<|endoftext|>

"I Feel The Fuck Like A Devil"

So you see me
It affects you, it affects me
You feel the fuck like a devil
I guess you're just a Devil

[irregular sway:]
Yes, I feel the fuck like a Devil

[repeat:]
No, I'm sorry, I can't lie
To our little secret, we barely remember who we came for
And now the tide is turning
Yeah, I kinda feel the same
But I still need to know
Things that you did for a living
That made me sick

<|endoftext|>

"JUGGLES"

I saw the future and I cried
I guess I should've stayed
But I should've stayed forever

In the blink of an eye
You can't escape from this moment
No matter what you desire
Just keep moving, keep going

I'm left behind
Like all the others
Some fall for you
It doesn't make much difference if they do

Once you get to know me
There's no reason why you shouldn't stay
There to hold me up
As I smile and laugh and dance
Along with all the others
You know it's time for me to leave

<|endoftext|>

"JUGGLES"

[Hold:]
OK, so now that you've seen all of the flashbacks
You know all you need to know

Cast all of these off
Stop replaying
Stop thinking
Suck out your tears

Fuck yourself
So hard you can't swim
And all of the above
Will never be right
What you need most
Don't want to believe

Cast your off
Stop wasting your time
This shit never gonna leave

[Repeated]

Overwhelmingly we're
A) stuck in this shit alone
B) coming home
C) not escaping out of the blue
D) surviving off the hype
E) maybe not getting along
F) anything but the truth has come to be
G) getting squeezed out
H) getting squeezed out
I) losing out
J) getting lost
K) hopefully in hell
L) holy fuck

"Charlatan"

[Spoken word:]
"Fuck you, bastards!"
"I will kiss you goodbye"
"Fuck you, you're-"
"Who the fâ€” is he trying to please?"
"You're trying to kill me. You're trying to kill your life."
"Who is he hurting me for?"
"You're killing me."

Now that you're gone I'm dying
Give me a sign
That you're okay
Deadhead lies beneath
Memories all over me
All over yourself

I'm dying

Please stop trying to fix me
What's the point?
I'm dying

Life tries to fix you
Deadhead lies across my
Doom
Summon up your ghosts
And I'll head for the hills
The Chosen One

Give me a sign
That he's loving me
Deadhead lies amidst my
Raining down
The Force
I'll head for the hills
The Chosen One

Give me a sign
That he's loving me
Deadhead lies amidst my
Raining down
The Force
I'll head for the hills
The Chosen One

It's time for me to deal

I'm going to the hills
The Chosen One

You're fighting just behind
All you've got is "now"
But who's to say who's the one?

<|endoftext|>

"Karma"

This ship is now under water
And I'm frightened
I'm helpless
I don't know what to do

If I stay here for
One more day
I will disappear

What do you think?
Do you feel hopeless
Not knowing what to do

I'm stuck
This is it
I'm in the game
Now you feel it

"Changelogs"

"Take Me Away"

November
Twin burners on the fire
I'll be your guide tonight
They're my only fuel
