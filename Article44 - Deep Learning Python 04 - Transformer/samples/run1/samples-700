"In Loving Memory"

A Tempting Offer
You Tempt The World
A Heartbreaking Decision
Have We Moved On
Or Should We Be Gracing The Cusp Of Another World
Anymore
Our Chance Of Finally Leaving The Clusterfuck

Written on the Leaves
Memories dissipate
Paradise came like a Storm
As all sides close their eyes
One last time
Weighing the Options
One last time
Weighing the Options

Weighing the Options
One last time
Weighing the Options
A final gesture
Weighing the Options
One last time

Moving in circles
One last time
Weighing the Options
One last time
Moving in circles
One last time
Weighing the Options
One last time

"Never Have"

To those who answer: I believe in my songwriting
We must not to overstate the importantness
Of our task
When we put one foot in front of the other we are bound
We can never have all the answers

In the face of uncertainty, we search for the answers
When faith in the voice of our hearts
Is at stake
When the street is red and we see black it is our house
of cards, but a lord is on the line
When we concede, we lose our edge of perception

We search for a balance between grace and death
A manifestation of the moon, a shadow of the body, body and soul
carries a message of mercy
and if we unite, we can save lives
if not just at the feet of God

We search for a balance between grace and death
A manifestation of the moon, a shadow of the body, a shadow of the body, body and soul
carries a message of grace

We search for a balance between grace and death
A manifestation of the moon, a shadow of the body, a shadow of the body, as well as soul
carry a message of grace

Once we admit our guilt as sinners
we are saved
salvation through the grace of confession

Once we admit our sins as sinners
we are saved
salvation through the grace of confession

Penalties dictate our lives
Our fevered bodies left behind
in barrels filled with gasoline

Shelter by the scabs dressed in black
Luring in to cover up
Usual suspects found
captured the ungrateful
in a sea of guilt and regret

Tired of being down
at the drop of a dime
We have somewhere to put my record
You got lost, buddy
I don't know where you are

Can't hold on
as I roll my record
Down the hole while the population screams
There goes my soul

Stare silly at the epithets
of the late '00s
people dressed in black
Luring in to cover up
Usual suspects found
captured the ungrateful
in a sea of guilt and regrets

Stare silly at the epithets
of the late '00s

Music was an invitation, buddy
I rode with his memory
And while we were on the roadway
One of the scabs led me by the hand to the site of the ogre's grave
So I smiled and waved goodbye to that poor old white boy
Who would wish such a thing on our son
And smiled as he passed my door

Through the rain we passed the crossroad
Beneath the mire a view from high heaven
And if you will bear with me
I beg your forgiveness my son
Bear with me in my sanctuary
Our blessed son

"Beneath the Mire"

When I'm down
There's a voice calling me, say what I need to know
And when I'm good
There's a story that I'd sooner take, say goodbye
Rising and changing, and when the spirits come
with loud thunders
I'll harness them to guide me
To slay them all time
When the voices of the night
Call me back to life
 frighten me from my sleep

When I'm down
There's a voice calling me, say what I need to know
And when
