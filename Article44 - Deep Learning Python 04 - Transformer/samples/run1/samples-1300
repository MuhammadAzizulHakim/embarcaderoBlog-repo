 that fear
and the way it lights my fire
Shame on you
I mean no one cares
No one cares

Hey, why don't you just kill yourself
I guess I don't kill a soul

I've been clinging to this idea of my own
And it won't end
All together I'm resting upon my own ashes

I've been clinging to this idea of my own
And it won't end
All together I'm resting upon my own ashes

I've been clinging to this idea of my own
And it won't end
All together
I'm resting upon my own ashes
I'm learning to live

"Scene Six: Finally Free"

[Hypnotist:]
You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light.
Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime.
As the light dissipates you will slowly fade into
the night, remembering all you have said and done.

I can hear your voice through glass
Is burning as it ages
Your spirit now, I can hear it
Now we are once again

[Hypnotist:]

Open your eyes Nicholas!
Find all you have said and done
And remember that you were not alone in...

[Miracle:]
Friday
The sky was clear and frigid
The air was thick and still
The feeling was highly flaking

I tried to shut the door
But it said shut down
As my hands were still

[Nicholas:]
Thank you for your time
We will be standing by

[Stepson:]

If you are still around
You will see my son
You really are my son

[Stepson:]

We will be standing by

[Nicholas:]

Only wish
To hear your voice again

[Narrator:]

He had a good impression of you
Friday

Friday was a good Friday for me and I was very glad
To hear your voice on this tape
It really was a good idea.

[Miracle:]

I thought that I would
Find a way for it to end
Something good would come out of this
I thought that I would
Capture the feeling that I had in you
Friday

I still Have A Word
With God(?), son
I still Have A Word
With God(%,x), son
I still Have A Word

I had gotten used to the feeling
Of getting chased by a giant
And wanted to find out
How easy it was to run away
On and on and on and on it goes

I've been running from fear
I've been hiding inside my own crying

I've been hiding inside my own crying

I've had the courage to go down alone
And wanted to get out of this alive
While running on my own

"Scene Eight: Finally Free"

[Hypnotist:]
You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light.
Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime.
Let the light lead you away from any thoughts of losing yourself and into this lifetime.

There is a void surrounding you
That allows the ether to move
As ether fills your body with strong winds

There is a need in yourself
Inside a dream that makes you want to fly
And a feeling of elation that makes you wish you'd never left your home

[Arhys:]
As I walk through all my myths and connected with your withered spirit
There is an urgency that comes to the point
Trying to break through
There is a burden that must be met
Before the beasts will retreat
And the gullible will lose their faith

There is a void surrounding you
That allows the ether to move
As ether fills your body with strong winds

There is a need in yourself
Inside a dream that makes you want to fly
And a feeling of elation that makes you wish you'd never left your home

"II. One Last Time"

[N:]
It doesn't make much difference if one goes away
If one doesn't help in the end
A bleeding heart led today's futile holocaust
There's no time to lose
And no time to explore
There's no reason why you should be afraid

There was a time that this was necessary
Forfeit all your points of view
As you begin to piece it all together
So begin the piercing rays
Upon the final touch

I saw a trail of blood now
There was a meaning in all our lives
I remember when blood was cold and distant
But now it's all gone now

I must go back to my
