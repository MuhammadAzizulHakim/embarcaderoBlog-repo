Wearing all my fears aside, what's his next move?
Pursuing the same agenda twice as long

He's not the man I believed
He's plagued his heroes with vain hopes
With an iron fist and a gun
What he ends up shedding is righteous might

Wearing all my fears aside, what's his next move?
Pursuing the same agenda twice as long

It's time we reevaluate
What he ends up shedding is righteous might

"Benighted"

Standing on the fringe of humanity, he watched from beyond the grave.
Came back to find me standing still.
Lost sight of all my ambitions.
All that I could do.
Lost sight of what I needed to do, right here beside you.
Benighted is what we call our lives in this world.
All we're really like.
We're our mistakes.
Blinded by circumstance.
Benighted is what we call our lives in this world.
Ignorant and detached, we hide from our mistakes.

Our lives never really mattered.
Lost in a world of distraction.
Saw me through a window.
Feigning my own worth.
Tried to rise to the sky
With my eyes open wide.
Showed me what I could be.
To everyone I met,
This place we call our home is theirs alone.
Here we are, my people's last resort.

We may be past the point of no return.
Where there's shame in our deeds anymore,
We've found love in what you've done.
And what you've done is what we should all admire.

Benighted is what we call our lives in this world.
Now where there's hope,
There's a reason to believe.
Hope lies in our eyes.

Benighted is what we call our lives in this world.
Now where there's hope,
There's hope for mankind.
Benighted is what we call our lives in this world
Now where hope lies,
Our lives inside

"Brother, Can You Touch Me?"

[Sample is Meryl Streep from the film "Falling In Love".]
"Can you touch me?
Is love alive or has it died?"
I can't write this down.
Can't you write it down?
It's time to turn it around.

I remember when we were kids we went out to the park and ran into somebody called Jeremy Irons.
He was a local paper boy and was known for his picturesque streets.
There he sat and smiled. 'Cause he was staring down at the clock.
He said,
"Can you touch me?"
And smiled wide.
He touched his finger.

I can't write this down.
Can't write this down?
It's time to turn it round.

I remember when we were kids we went out to the park and ran into somebody called Jeremy Irons.
He was a bit eccentric, but he had an idol in him.
He said,
"Can you touch me?"
And smiled wide.
He said,
"Can you touch me?"
And smiled wide.

"Bridges And Walls"

To this day I find it hard to sleep
To imagine what is to come
The day when I will have nothing but the thoughts left behind
To imagine when I will be gone

Sleep or wake up.
To feel something, be something.
To dream something, see something
To dream an end, you will have to stay

Nevermind how it may have been
And all that will flow from now to forever

Dreaming of what it must be like to be left behind
Lost inside a dream
What now now then
This is what you will return to
As you disappear
This is what you will return to

I will search the skies
Always bearing this past down
The moment when life will leave me alone

I'll never forget the first time we shared the same bed
The morning blurted out: "May God grant us joy and pain."
All of us were
