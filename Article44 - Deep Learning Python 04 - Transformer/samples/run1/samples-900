 child from a position of trust
This feeling can be so great at times
To know the pride and dignity that lies ahead
When my son can return from school this fall
Will this feeling ever fade from my heart?

Could this feeling ever go away?
Surrounded by love and inspired by tragedy
Would that I could be there for them?

Even if my heart was a gun
I'd still be lying here with hope shattered
Surrounded by love and inspired by tragedy
Is this feeling that I feel when I see a ghost?

Surrounded by love and inspired by tragedy
Would that I could be there for them?
Even if my heart was a gun
I'd still be lying here with hope shattered
Surrounded by love and inspired by tragedy
Would that I could be there for them?

"Great Expectations"

A summer day
In garlands I feel secure
A useless faith
That I will get you, somehow

A guitar player says no
After all the fun they had
Which ones was your most current

Great Expectations

I'll try, hopefully
Great Expectations

You're dancing only your way
There's no love lost
And no betrayal involved
How could I tell you
Don't play by the rules?

Great Expectations

And we'll try again
Great Expectations

But you're only there for me
And I get to dictate your lives

"The Great Debate"

You make so many great scientific discoveries
You get so good at what you do
You get a doctorate in physicals
You get a doctorate in medicine
You get a doctorate in engineering

You make so many great advances
How can I tell you
Don't ever play a role in something that you do

If we asked you to name a single science
You'd be eager to share it
You're one of those people
Who could run on a tank
And tell me how we can make it
Now let's say we could fly
And see what happens
If we could talk forever
You'd be very, very happy

But you're a letdown like any other
child
You're not allowed in your home
Homebrewing, somehow
Your kids will growl

Life is so simple (My, My, My)
It's no surprise that you biochemically
Difficult to sleep at night

You make so many great discoveries
How can I tell you
Don't ever play a role in something that you do

If we asked you to name a single scientific discovery
You'd be eager to share it
You're one of those people
Who could run on a tank
And tell me how we can make it

If We Couldn't Wait
And See How It Would Turn Into A Movie
You'd be very, very happy

But You're A Letdown Like Any other

Your kids will be screaming
Misunderstood, kids will be screaming
Liar, liar
Liar, liar

"The Bigger Picture"

[Undertone:]
Drawing the line
Luring in the shadows
But firm and true
its all in the painting
Its all in the painting
Its all in the painting

We're driving on the shoulder of the road
Where no-one sees us
No one even knew we existed
And no-one has a clue
What we're up to is far from high heaven

And we both walk the wrong way
(Do both have toes on the wheel)
(Do both laugh)

We're drinking at the Inn at the wrong time
(Do the eyes deceive you?)
(The spoon is your salvation, the dose your poison?)

(The glasses you never used
You steal from the holiness of emptiness
The Bennett Kink, and only laugh)

(The vase you carry is your temple)
(The phone you use is your gold, it will guide you to your dreams!)

(The painting you're looking at)
