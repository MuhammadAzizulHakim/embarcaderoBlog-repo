The sun
As we walk by
Will it set the new world
Upon our eyes?

[English translation:]

He came to lies
to tell lies
about
things that never were
about dreams that still can't be
about loving,
voting,
 organizing, holding, and
breathing life anew.

How could I be so surprised?
Lad he ever was.


He said he's coming to stay
He said he's the son of a bitch
And you should've seen that coming.

How could I be so surprised?
Lad he ever was?

He's not welcome in lies
He's not welcome in lies

He wanted to rape me so bad
He wanted to make me leave my
dream of youth
He wanted to kill me to take his place.

How could I be so surprised?
Lad he ever was?

He said he's coming to stay
He said he's the son of a bitch
And you should've seen that coming.

"Wait For Sleep"

This voice you're hearing
Is familiar, isn't it?


It's not your body
It's not your dreams
It's just a feeling
Kinda like the way you woke up in the
Daylight

It's getting darker
And darker it gets
Here's a cautionary tale
You'll like this about other
dreams too:

A fever is a curse
Always hard to get across
Even when I'm on my knees
Everyone's perfectly fine now

Someone tell me not to worry
It's just a question of concentration
Always hard to get across

I was told there was a poison in me
I just needed to sleep
I'm a rational human
I'm perfectly fine now

And now it's time for sleep
I should've told you what I was thinking
I should've told you what I's thinking now

I'm a freak
I'm scared too
I'm finding it hard to hang from a Dream

When I'm asleep you can tell me
You're following me too

If I still have to push it away
It's just an illusion
There's too much you can do
Don't want to see this to be true

"Ghost Of A Down"

Ghost of a down
Locked in a corner
By my side turned the page
Blank face in my head
Locked in a corner
By the door
I tried to open
5 degrees and shut it
My blood-stained hands went to the door

My blood-stained hands went to the door

My veins went to the stone
And shaded keys in your hand
My face had to be there
 All my all

Then they took your money, put it in your mouth
Locked you in a corner, I swear
Free the ghosts of a dream
And taught me how to beat 'em round

"Face Of A Down"

Underneath your feet
Staring at the screen
Trying to say something
You can't see through their lies

Face of a down
Locked in a corner
Underneath your feet
Staring at the screen
Trying to say something
You can't see through their lies

Oh, what are they going to say?
What are they going to say?

They took your money, put it in your mouth,
Took your money, gave it to me,
You bet your life

I wish I'd never seen that.
I wish I'd never seen that they went and spent their own money on me.
I wish I'd never fucking said that!

You think you're cool, Kid?
Think you're cool, Kid?

You think you're cool, Kid?

Fuck you, Kid.
Fuck you, Kid.

Fuck
