-dream the rest of my days

When will my anger disappear?
When will it subside?
When will it take all of me?

"Faaip Sur"

I don't understand why you can't be happy
Just because the sky is blue.I don't mean to be happy.
When will that end?
When will this desertion?"

You belong in the red fog
When the children will crawl away

You are the one who talks
The one with the silver hairline

You are the one who smiles
The one whose brain waves hurt

You are the one whose brain waves hurt

So I take what is mine does
And try to forget you

When will that end?
When will this desertion be worth it?

"Black Rose"

The pills in my blood thinner
So I take what is mine does
And try to forget you

When will that end?
When will this desertion be worth it?

"Pills The Sun"

Sir, my dear David
If you would, could send a message
To those who may be missing
Tell me how we can
And how we should carry on
If the winds of change
Stay strong David

Sir, my beloved and trusted friend
If you could only send a message
Tell me how we can
And how we should carry on
If the wind of change
Will whisper in your ear

We must keep our calm
We must keep our fire burning

The more words we have,
The less time we have
To contemplate
The more we bleed,
The less time we have
To bear,
The more time we cry

We must keep our calm
We must keep our flame burning

"Perfect Strangers"

Honouring our debts to memory
We rise from the ashes
To pay the bills
And smile the shutdown faces

He'll be here by the way
The new American dream
A pound for a pound difference

Time to pay the bills
And smile the shutdown faces

He'll be here by the way
The new American dream
A pound for a pound difference

Time to pay the bills
And smile the silence

And still life
When we pay the sky
Hanging on by two legs
We can laugh about it
But don't let it shadow your morning

Cry when the rain is pouring down
Cry when the rain is pouring down
When will it disappear?

When will it disappear?
When will it disappear?

When will it disappear?
When will it disappear?

"A Tempting Offer"

Remember me friend
Remember me friend
It's time for you to surrender
To face your loneliness and THE HAND


Feeling hopeless and unknown
Feeling insecure and unknown
Feeling worthless and worthless

Hold on boy
You must keep your head up high
You must ask yourself,
Should I climb back out of the hole
Or should I take the time
To look my way

I gotta ask myself
Can I climb back out of the hole
I gotta ask myself

Thought I'd help it all out
A little
I thought I'd give it away
A little more
Give it away
A little more

Take it away

Feeling hopeless and unknown
Feeling insecure and unknown
Feeling your time's up

Shameless now felt like I was giving away a heart
Taking it away

Feeling hopeless and unknown
Feeling your time's up

Take it away

Feeling insecure and unknown
Feeling your time's up

Take it away

Feeling insecure and unknown
Feeling your time's up

Yeah, taking it away
Takes it away
Takes it away
Yeah it's time
Take it away

"Once Again"

[Sample is Julian Sands from the 1981 film "Slither", an adaptation of James Joyce's short story from his book]
"The Trouble With Evan",
"Innocent when caught,
Or at least heard about,

Two days ago
I was with my parents, and I just sat and watched TV.
And there was a boy, nine, holding a gun
And I said, "what the hell is going on?"

He looked at me in disbelief,
"what the hell is going on?"

Then he looked me in the eye and said,
"once again,
"you're subject to a higher death burden
