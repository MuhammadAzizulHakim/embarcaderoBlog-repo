"In the spirit of departure"

From the golden years
When the cosmos was small
Our universe
We don't know
But still
We came to feel
Away
From the eternal boy

"The Best Of Times"

If you wanna dream
Of the future
Somewhere where you belong

Eternal son
You'll grow up
Shoulder to beeper
than any
Carry out your plan
Till you're No. 1

You feel no one cares
No one cares enough
Forget all about your dreams
Wash your hands of regret
In the name of humanity

You feel no one cares
No one cares enough
Forget all about your dreams
Wash your hands of regret
In the name of humanity

When I was a child
I thought we'd be fine
If we could glide
On our way to prosperity
Now we're through the trade
Of being spoiled once again

We're through the trade
Of being spoiled once again

Trading lives for wealth
A journey to wealth
For the sole purpose of doing
Right by my children
Someday they'll need
A place to hide

When I was a child
I thought we'd be fine
If we could glide
On our way to prosperity
Now we're through the trade
Of being spoiled once again

We're through the trade
Of being spoiled once again

"Chrysalis"

And now I find my home
And so have I pleasures
And apart from my sorrows
I am content

In the midst of chaos
There is beauty in the chaos
There is no secretariat
There is only one tyrant

There walks a god but I am him
There walks a god but I am him
But I am only as strong as my hand

And so I am born again
And now at last my home is secure

There walks a god but I am him
There walks a god but I am him
But I am only as strong as my hand

And so I am born again
And now at last my home is secure

There walks a god but I am him
There walks a god but I am him
But I am only as strong as my hand

[The Devil takes control:]
You are dying
Decide to end your life
Then again, you've been through worse
Most of the time
In your sleep, you know
So I'm trying to believe

The Devil takes control

Now you're killing my kids
You must be the one
Who said I was wrong
Never said I was wrong

Dead inside
I know what you're thinking
This could be their last shot
Dead inside
I know what you're thinking

It's time for you to make a choice
I'll try my best to help you
In the name of humanity

[The Devil takes control:]
Calvin, Hobbes, Karl Marx
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
This could be their last shot
Dead inside
I know what you're thinking
This could be their last shot

Let them keep from killing
But shoot them with care
(Don't shoot the prophets, you thieving monkeys with your bare hands)
Let them keep from killing
But shoot them with care
(Don't shoot the prophets, you thieving monkeys with your bare hands)

How many more will die
Before the beast is gone?
Before the devil takes his place
Before the devil takes his place

I'll try my best
To help you at your peril
Let them keep from killing
(Don't shoot the prophets, you thieving monkeys with your bare hands)
Let them keep from killing
But shoot them with care
(Don't shoot the prophets, you thieving monkeys with your bare hands)

"Wilsonian CRASH"

The sound of sirens getting stronger
The roadway ahead
Slight bend in the road
Shallow crash course
Too many choices but let each one be
How many have died
So you can wash your hands of this

Innocent until proven guilty
People in wheelchairs
After all the damage
Have you ever seen a movie
Wait until the lights go down
And don't you but wonder
If
