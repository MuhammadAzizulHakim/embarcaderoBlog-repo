In my head
You're on your knees
Where the devil found you

I have never needed you
The blood of the sons of creators
You are my brother,
I'm your father (and my own flesh)

I can see you
We are going to save a people if we fight
These lies from the heart

Mother God
The truth is mine
No one is better than you

Don't cry
For your brother,
In your hands I will guide
You.

"Lure For Death"

You're losing your way
Now I know where all your lies lie

You put one finger down
And I'm reaching for life
And my father, I know where you lie lie

Now I know where you lie lie

You put one finger down
And I'm reaching for life
And my father, I know where you lie

Now I know where you lie lie lie

It's time
Your lies are revealed

"The Best Of Enemies"

I was born from your blood
And my enemies are my brothers.

You were always just your own
And you'll always be the best of friends

In my home of fear inside
A hole, a memory
Your mother told me

I will return if you're strong
Just when the soil breaks,
The night will come
And you'll be right here

In your home of wealth and power
A hole, a memory
Your mother told me

My home of danger
A hole, a memory
You promised me

You were only born
To build a home inside you
That you could love

And I will carry on
If you're strong

I will return if you're strong

It's time
Your lies are revealed
You must be strong
You must be

No one is better than you

Hear the truth from the past
The lie is mine

"Falling In Love"

A young man is sold by his father
to find a wife
that is his own
He never thought he'd get
But he's got love (and it's coming)
and a place where they belong

A feeling inside me.
I felt falling in love
with you
with your love.
I found my voice and you fell in love
with me

"Love Me or Die"

A young woman, in what looks like a school of love
dialing, gets into a taxi.

She's in love,
and she knows
what to do.
She decides she'd rather be with us than
we're here. In a world that keeps repeating
The days where you'd crawl to your bed early
And the pills would make all your dreams come true
But we're gone.

She gets to her bed early
And gets a new phone.

On it are my notes and a love letter from
my dear girl.
She presses the key
and we start flying back to love.

"Halo"

Well, a little while for us...

We got into life together
and then the whole hell went wrong
The angel of our love
sparked her fire
and turned her into the man she always wanted to be

And what we got
was everything.

And if we were honest about it (and I mean almost everyone in the world
now)
Then you'd be amazed -
'nay amazed - what our lives could be like
Now she'd be the one to give
Our lives back to you

"Fell The New Born"

Well, we lost count
We had to have a family
Our home in Wales
was built out of a box...

We had to have a home in Bohemia and
Celtices, where people could speak
And a house that they could sleep on...

And if we were honest (and I mean honest)
We could have it all
And if we were as open as a mother's
love we'd have it all...

Well...
Well....

(What was it? I don't know)

How could you lose a family?
Well when you lose a family
your daughter is out of luck!

(Is it the devil that the devil calls?)

How could you lose a household
a place that had been our site for
about three centuries? [4]

Well
You get a blank page
and someone
makes it happen
And the devil keeps the
