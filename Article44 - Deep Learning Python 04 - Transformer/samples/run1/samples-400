 as
How I feel
We can't tell you otherwise
Our sins against you
Tell me how you want to be remembered
Or watch your back

How can I feel forgotten if I'm raging inside
If only I lived a bit easier
A little less heartened if I didn't always feel this way

Self pity
spouses fault me
I'm not the person you thought or prayed to be
Misled, I humbled you. Trust me, I humbled you

"The Devil's Orchard"

[I. ABOUT TO CRASH]

I have been expecting my son.
Sitting in traffic, his mother reaches for the wheel.
Chasing after a dream. Tracing past turns and corners.
Never enough to deserve what's coming
Whoa they are,
Soaring up into the sky.

And my heart bleeds
Every time I drive by
It keeps me going off the track

And I have come to terms with this
That the world has become a little bit too neat
That everything is somehow my big surprise
That everything just doesn't feel all that right and all that special

Finger into the car, it's an F-breather.
Finger into the pedal...

[II. ABOUT TO CRASH]

I had a vision for my son
He could be an adult now
And I swore an oath to God that I would give him away
And I'm not going home tonight...

[III. ABOUT TO CRASH]

I just need you more
Because you're doing just fine
And I won't stop you from going on
And I'm just getting
Nooo..."

It's getting dark
So I put my foot down
I don't have much time
And you can see I've come to save you
From myself
Now it's getting dark
So I put my foot down
I don't have much time
And you can see I've come to save you
From yourself
Now it's getting dark

"Crawl Away"

[I. REFLECTION] [00:00 â€“ 19:49]

I got some advice today from my Uncle
He's a monster show that he's basking
He said, "You know what, it doesn't work like that
Do what you must to keep the car door closed"

It's a mystery why I always end up behind the wheel
I'm getting behind the wheel, I'm getting behind
I'm turning right turn into left turn
I'm not turning back around
And the angel stops at the top of the scale

"Bridges In The Sky"

[VI. SUNSET]

I didn't know what a day was
So I locked myself inside the cage
And watched the spiders in question
Bathed in muddy water
And watched the children play
Altered Planet, where we thought it would be
Altered Planet, where we will be
It's always a while
Until the day we knew the future

Until the universe had already happened
And all that remained in our heads was speculation
Cosmology gave us clues
In the year 996

[VII. SOLITARY HEAVEN]

A few simple prayers
Helped spark a dream
That her would power immortal
And would descend to earth
When Earthfall Would Come

And the angel on the mountain made a loud noise
He led the way
Into the smoke to collect his debts
And the poor fellow collected what he needs
And left for the cold wastelands of space

And the spider in the window
Poured a pleasant poison over his clothes
Bearing cold chillia, its a mystery why it's cold there
We used our mightiest hands to pull the trigger

We could wait a lifetime
Though the chance of saving a life might seem insignificant
In the years to come

"The Chosen One"

[I. The Monster In The Sky]
A mother sings a lullaby to a forgotten man
They ask, "Who is waiting for us today?"
And the man replies, "The Chosen One"

Music is a vehicle to entice the child
Of a thousand designs
To his endless parade of desire

While we're at it
We're blowing smoke
