======================================== SAMPLE 78 ========================================
To find out what's behind this Sunset Strangler facade

Finding the lake under the sun
Lake Huron
Saw movement in bookish hour
A whaleish glance from ageless daddy
Dreadful eye trace on celestial scale
Warped inside its dark vessel

And as I sail on shore
I relax to the end
To soar above the sun
While through seaman's apse
Lost in themopharmac

And I’ll stay on the shoreline
To laugh and cry

Warped inside its darkness
Seaman’s eye
On celestial scales

"The Sound Of Muervous Sleepers"

One hundred rooftops stretch
Across a crowded skyline naked with tourists
I meet with depressed tourists
Preying on ignorance and anger

Whistle burners, plastic pills, ecstasy
Smoke in my eyes
Flowers in my garden, sterile gloves
Wearing sterile clothes
Sharing space with those who don't care

Elevenies razzmatazzi’s
suit and tie
suit and tie
tie
suit and pyjamas

Your disease boiling underneath the heat
Your pockets stocked with secrets
Your bleeding secrets flowing from my hand

Blinding light as radioactive water
Blinding light as water
Blinding light as radioactive water

"Continuum"

Empty house, and empty pockets
There's an echo in the hall
I keep your picture in a locket
In the past, we had it all
But the Summer fades away
Rainy day tomorrow

In the company of men like
Cop, bug, and fly
I'm always waiting for you

"The Sound Of Muervous Sleepers"

The sound of music
Shows the sound of rain falling
Tyres of sweat pouring down my face

<|endoftext|>

"Sleeping Giant"

The smile of morning as I see you
Slave under my creed
Brown skin is able to hold the selection
Craving new freedom
I am able to live my own life

Every day give and cry
Every breath leaves me hotter
I am able to move beyond coz I've been taken

I'm able to control the world
Now I'm able to move beyond nothing
I'm able to move beyond love

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make up runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my dreams are gone
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are wrong
 Ghana, love me, it's cold there
Sweden I've always been, love me

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a place where all my dreams are wrong

Swedish for "my home".

"Ghost Of A Lifetime"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got a scar where all my dreams are gone
I got a life there with a future inside
Swedish for "my home".

"Lost Years"

The girl in the mirror
Remember me, as daughter of a funfair
Now she's aiming higher
She'll swing a hundred at the same

She is alone and insecure
Talking to herself on the go
A few hundred words wasted
She'll never be let down

She is fragile now, but she's learning to survive
She is swimming in conflict

The unreflective stranger
Underneath the casual eye
Will eat at any weakness
And will complain when anyone disagrees

She is wrong and she is right
News media reaction deafening
She'll find herself in a shelter
Sheer silence as all people leave

She is wrong and she is right
News media reaction deafening
She'll find herself in a shelter
Sheer silence as all people leave
