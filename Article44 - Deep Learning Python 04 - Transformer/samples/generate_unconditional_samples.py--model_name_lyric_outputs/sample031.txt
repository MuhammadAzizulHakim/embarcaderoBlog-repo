======================================== SAMPLE 31 ========================================
Work it to the roof, steal from the angels

I can't remember the last time
I was sick and tired of waiting
And tired of hating all those who disagreed

Blood...Heal me
Fear...Change me
Belief will always save me
Blood...Heal me
Fear...Change me
Belief will always save me

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all who might Concern
Or Concern At All

Know me then
And if you would
Call yourself a friend
Then I may have found the answer
But you're not there yet
You're clinging to your poison haze
Like a dead link
In a pool of coals

If you would
Call yourself a man
Then I may have found the answer
But you're not there yet
You're clinging to your haze
Like a dead link
In a pool of coals

"We have to keep this a secret from the world."
Hoping that this step might help
That I may have found the answer
But I'm not there yet
You are sinking like a stone
Don't know what you're doing
Just another day

Knowing I forgot is still a crime
But I had given all that I could take
I ruined your life before you took all that you got
I'm your burden now
It's only vice versa

I want to feel my way back home again
I want to feel my way back home
Now I know why I've come with you today
It's because of what you lost that day I learned

"A Less Ridiculous Crime"

Someone was murdered and everyone is scared
There were mace blows and knife wounds
There was luring and pushing
Someone was killed and the peace was broken
 There was blood on the ground
And no-one was hurt

There was more murder but there was still something left
There were holes in the floor and in the ceiling
There was a scar on her back
That made her scream

She was alone and afraid
There was nothing for days
Her days were numbered

She had a dream that day
She thought that she would die
She waited for a day when she would finally feel
She woke up
To find that she had lost her love
She had a nightmare that day
She thought that she would die
She waited for a day when she would finally feel
She woke up

She had lost her love
She had a nightmare that day
She thought that she would die
She waited for a day when she would finally feel
She woke up

She had lost her love
She had a nightmare that day
She thought that she would die
She waited for a day when she would finally feel
She woke up

"Hooker With A Penis"

I met a boy wearing Van, 501,
And a dope Beastie T,
Nipple rings
New tattoos that claimed that he
Was OGT,
Back from '92,
From the first EP.

And in between sips of Coke
He told me that he thought
We were sellin' out,
Layin' down,
Suckin' up to the man.

Well now I've got some advice for you, little buddy.
Before you point your finger you must understand that I'm the man.
If you're listenin to music the way I guitarized, then you're already familiar with the sound and feel of my Lotus Eyes black plastic.
But if you're not paying attention you're missing something.

When Iifty Twentieth, I was still a pretty good band.
And I really wanted you to know, by the way,
I thought that you and I would make a record.
Well watch where you're drinking, buddy.
 It doesn't matter what you own,
You can always buy a record.

But you don't wanna play rock and roll, don't you?
And I guess I can't hold on too long.
Because, like, all my heroes have advanced degrees in some way.
And I wanted you to know, by the way,
I own a farm, so maybe I could hold on for a bit.
But for your picture, I must say that I'm sorry.
It's just something I had to do...
I guess I'm fine?"

I'm sorry if I didn't understand your question
at the time, but I think it's important enough that we all step aside and step aside
And let the music pass right by.

Without a doubt.
An overwhelming feeling
Waiting on my neck and stomach

I need
