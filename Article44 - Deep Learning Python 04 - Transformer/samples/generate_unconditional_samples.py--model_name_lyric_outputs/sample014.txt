My brothel
And my grave
So there you are
With all your dreams shattered
Locked in a place where all your dreams are dead
My brothel
And my grave
So there you are
So there you are

"Fear In The Eyes Of Others"

Free spirit on piss and water
Pure caffeine
Under a shadow of fear
There's never a chance of getting away

In a field of rejoicing
There's never a chance of getting away

And butterfly weaving
Cuffsteps down the hill
As the sky gets dark
And stars fall
We've never been so lonely

"The Looking Glass"

I would not expect you felt unnoticed and ignored
Better to rise above the clouds Then be a stranger in the crowd
All that you protectedistic, radical
Isn't worth what you have seen

You're always helping me
Being forgotten is the price that you pay
You're the price that you pay

You're not the only one
I'm finding it hard to hang
I'm always trying to find more
When does this word delinquency stop me from wasting days

You're the rotted blight on my skyline
Takin' in the summer with the 4398 left alone
Nothing will prepare me for the worst

And on and on and on it goes
And no-one is listening
Does this mean nothing this time?

Watch where I can't sit anymore
I'm getting feelings that keep getting stronger
Is this the end-all-be-all plan?
You're the rotted blight on my skyline
Took all of you for a ride
Took all of you for a ride
Now no one is listening
Does this mean nothing this time?

"The Bigger Picture"

Close to nine o'clock the moon looks down
The west coast for a while
Jaded underworld leads the way

The big-budget monster film
A million volts crashing through the glass
Landing on the wrong side of the law
Not content with this one violent betrayal
It pursues in to the end

We Were Here That Yearning To Be Giant
Space jacked forever and unable to rest
After a while

Watch where I can't sit anymore
I'm getting feelings that keep getting stronger
Is this the end-all-be-all plan?
You're the rotted blight on my skyline
Took all of you for a ride
Took all of you for a ride
Now no one is listening
Does this mean nothing this time?

"Dignity"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Faythe:]

I gave up on hope
Was dead inside
Stayed lost within a world I chose to hide
From all that would come my way

[Nafaryus:]

On the road to revolution
We're greeted by beauty
Behind her, the mask contours
The lies she tells
Over and over again
Will she ever return
To her blue days?

And still she talks about her love
And even her death

Could she really be a person?
If she's not the one, the one
She claims to know
Her true love is still a mystery

And still she talks about her love
And even her death

Could she really be a person?
If she's not the one, the one she claims to know
Her true love is still a mystery

And she plans to bloom again
While she's still young
And innocent
It won't be long until she's left alone
With feelings that keep burning inside

"Fall Into The Light"

Written on the water
Memories dissipate
Eyes begin to open
Darkness unearthed
Surrounded by peaceful skies

Lights take on new life
Sounds of metal, the ocean, the wind
Relieve your mind's travesty
A feather is a feather
But a true believer will find
A feather is worth a pound

Insects and trees kill
People just like me
