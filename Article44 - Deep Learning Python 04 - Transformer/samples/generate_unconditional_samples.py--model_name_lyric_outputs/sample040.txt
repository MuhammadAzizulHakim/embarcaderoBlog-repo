"Breaking Down The Dark"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]

As fearless leader of the Hill
He's welcomed us all with open arms

We look to you today
for guidance and reason
While night drifts over this empty plain
It's true what you've always believed
And tonight we'll turn to you

Rain keeps falling
Cultivating mystery
Lullabies of them all

Tonight we'll be learning all about his gift
From his secret lair

He is the embodiment of manliness
No matter what time it is
He will challenge you to the mark
And tonight we'll be conquering our war

"A New Beginning"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Faythe:]

Father is it true
He's the one
With a view
Of the end
Of this world
What does it take for us to live again?

He's the one
Who's on my back
With rebellion in check
My only friend
Who could set me free

[Arabelle:]

He's my daughter's worth
Getting lost in the moor
I'm afraid to tell her of my love

[Daryus:]

I'll keep her your way
I'll keep her safe from harm
I'll help to prepare for her end

[Faythe:]

I knew the day had come
And traveled to soothe the loss
I came to remember
The man who lit a fire to wash away the shame
Drawing us right in
On the flicker of a moment

I â€™m ready to welcome you all back

You are now
Fold away from me
As I am drawn into your light
I'm ready to embrace whatever it takes
You are my son, I am ready to welcome you all back

"The Enemy Inside"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Arhys:]

If there's a man who'll keep me sane
He will realize just how wrong we have been
And he'll call me a hero
Sure he will, he'll tell me how he feels
Just let me show you
But don't cry
Don't let him down

Into the sun
Lies the enemy inside
Thoughts race right on
Who can save us all

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]

This is how it's always been
You get what you want
And I get to keep the heart of it
With the world at war
My brother's side by my side
Leading to this decision

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]

Betray my blood
To save my son
A hopeless choice to make

But who am I?
If I still had anything left
I'd surely use my freedom
To my advantage

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]

Before you ask me why I'm fighting
I know that I'll never be alone
This battle has cost me so much
I can't keep away
And I must fight
To the death

Thoughts race right on
Who can save us all

"The Enemy Inside"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Narrator:]

Morning breaks beyond the wake of dawn
And she's a world away
Through crowded streets
This quiet heart of hers holds the key

[EXT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]

She's a girl you'll want
From the look of it
She's got ambitions higher than all the angels
And she'll be fine
As a bride she'll be fine

But she's never had a voice loud enough for me
She wants everyone happy
She's got a place where she'll always be
But she'll never be a parlour wizard
No matter how high she gets

Sheer courage unblinking
As she shunts the fight
Sheer determination unblinking

Sheer determination unblinking

I'm not fighting
I'm not leaving
I'm not alone
And I can't escape
Without you
I'm the one to know
There's bound to be a time
When I feel like I'm slipping
Down the cellar stairs
I'll
