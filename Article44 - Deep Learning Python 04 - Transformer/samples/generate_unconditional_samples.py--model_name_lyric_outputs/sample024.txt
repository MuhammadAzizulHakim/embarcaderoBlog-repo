======================================== SAMPLE 24 ========================================
Water drenched me in sweat
This melted skin was shelter from the sun
But trust me I never knew
It was you
Who loved me
who cared
what I sacrificed

Foot in mouth and head up ass
Fresh piss and blood
Seared flesh and mutilated remains
Slaughtered as a man would wish
For any man of my age

And I would perish beside you
If I wanted to
But you gave up hope
And now I find my faith in you
A mother smiles and tells me she's sorry
For giving me up
would I survive unless I stayed
Behind the Great Wall

Behind the Great Wall

"Until Last Chance to Win"

Promise is another stringency
It is another man having
To keep me sane
Keep me sane
Keep me sane
Keep me sane

And here I am again
And the price I pay
Is willing to let her down
And leave a void
And nowhere to call my name
And no one to call

Until last chance to win
Red line with me now
Blue line with me now

I see you
Stand by me now
Break of ice, stay behind
Give me one more moment

Red line with me now
Blue line with me now

I see you
Red line with me now
Blue line with me now

And here I am again
And the price I pay
Is willing to let her down
And leave a void
And nowhere to call my name
And no one to call

Until last chance to win
Red line with me now
Blue line with me now
Blue line with me now
Blue line

"Sleeping Giant"

[VI. Into The Light]

Light grows on a fire
Colds a winter day
Knew it from the moment I saw you

We walked across the country
The lake from where I fell
We watched you run across the country
Swallowed in the light

We walked across the country
Colds a winter day
Knew it from the moment I saw you

We walked across the country
Lightning speed
Drawn to the beckoning man
Through the night you guided us

We walked across the country
Colds a winter day
Knew it from the moment I saw you

We walked across the country

Lightning speed
Drawn to the beckoning man
Through the night you guided us

"Under A Glass Moon"

Tell me
Remind me
Chase the water racing from
the sky
Always beside me
Taste the memories running
from my eyes
Nervous flashlights scan my
dreams
Liquid shadows silence their
screams
I smile at the moon
Its white light reflects
the message I see
Its light reflects
the message I see

Running headlong
at the water's edge
I cannot reach
the part of you
that cries
I can't carry on
As I am running uphill
I'm reaching for the day

Running uphill
at the water's edge
I cannot reach
the part of you
that cries
I can't carry on
As I am running uphill
at the water's edge

"Silver Angel Eyes"

If you want to see
what's left behind
is left behind you sacrifice
every moment for one more moment

You believe me
You believe me
And all along
I tried to keep you sane
And sane I tried to keep you sane
But it's not you anymore
It's me alone

Someday
When I feel I'm cut out
I get all depressed
and some day I'll shoot myself
but that dream will never, ever come true

If I tell you a millionth time
you'll believe me
You'll blame me
But it's you alone

When I hear about the silver eyes
I'm saying there's nothing left
I'm admitting that I'm wrong
and there's no turning back

I've been through worse
But I didn't choose to be this way
I chose to be that way

Now the dawning of a new chapter
has arrived
Attention now for the first time
Familiar faces guide us

Turn to the stories
off the beaten path
Keep an eye on the gold light
Remember gold light
is our light

As we pass through the rooms of the last train
The waiting can get so bad
and so bad
the whole family grieves
all for one more day
