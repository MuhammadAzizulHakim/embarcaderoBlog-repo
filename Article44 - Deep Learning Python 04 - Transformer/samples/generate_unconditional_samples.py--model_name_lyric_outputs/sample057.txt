Please let me thru!

Epilogue

A pale shadow is cast on the wall
Like the final glade
Crept up the archways
And no-one is left to guide me
Through the darkest reaches of sorrow

Like a bird on a wire
Spinning past ominous aressas
Like a moonrise
Over treetops and gullies

I am pierced,
Yet I is free
I am consumed
I am everywhere

Caked in the soil,
Like fallen angels
Sunkist and Sudafed
produce,
Like angels in Soul Eater

I am consumed,
Yet I is free
I am consumed
I am everywhere
I am free
And what we have here is never free
I am consumed
I am everywhere

My thoughts are sailing by
And all of my fears are justified
As my thoughts are peaceful
I can contemplate most anything
My thoughts are burning with emotion
I swim in to calm them down
I watch the Sun move by
And all of my fears are justified
As my thoughts are peaceful
I can contemplate thoughts at all
My thoughts are burning with emotion
I'm through with my lives now
Waking up to your every need
Waking up to your dreams
And waking up with a sense of purpose
I'm drawing lines in the sand

"Sever"

Telepath Carbon trapped under stone
Brother mother pale body is thrown
Only way I know to have fun
Fill up my blood, my veins, my lungs

ESP city - rainy and blue
Burn down this town, I give it to you
Aero shallow, photograph blind
Stage fright, black light, coma divine

No sense of time
Sever tomorrow
ESP dying star, see distant horizon

ESP city - rainy and blue
Burn down this city, I give it to you
Aero shallow, photograph blind
Stage fright, black light, coma divine

No sense of time
Sever tomorrow
ESP dying star, see distant horizon

ESP city - rainy and blue
Burn down this city, I give it to you
Aero shallow, photograph blind
Stage fright, black light, coma divine

No sense of time
Sever tomorrow
ESP dying star, see distant horizon

"The Ones Who Help To Set The Sun"

Watching my window I was led like a
child
As the roadway lamplights
misguided my mind through the night
a shadow of limits
We were racing the rain
my hands held the wheel
My eyes tried to hold their place

there must have been a time
when I thought that you were
watching
It had to be when my senses lost
control
I thought I'd slipped away
I thought I could still feel us
moving
It must have been a cloud
no bigger than a man's hand

Every reason I risk my life
To come back to you
Is locked behind your door
You're my immunity
Outside I flow with deja vu

Every reason I risk my life
To come back to you
Is locked behind your door
You're my immunity
Outside I flow with deja vu

"Spring MCMLXXIV"

On a windless day
When I can see
The faces of those waiting
I am one of them
Arabelle is waiting
And she is alone
In the coldness of her heart

She is hiding a wish
That she know
It is all just an illusion
That she can't see
When she whispers, "you"
With a stifling moan
That leaves her throat gaping
And she can't move

She is hiding a wish
That she know
It is all just an illusion
That she can't see
When she whispers, "you"
With a stifling moan
That leaves her throat gaping
And she can't move

She is hiding a wish
That she know
It is all just an illusion
That she can't see
When she whispers, "you"
With a stifling moan
That leaves her throat gaping
And she can't move

"Halo"

She said God is dead
God is dead
God is dead
God is dead
