======================================== SAMPLE 26 ========================================
Of what the future holds
Historical facts and dreams
Remembered thoughts and dreams
Warped in on us all

People disappear
Telepathically boundless
Immune to reason

Emerald thoughts flow through your consciousness
Immune to light
Shiny visions of what you thought
Illuminating what you thought
Immune to light

Beyond the dream
Staring out at the world
Tearing limbs from the world
Viewing the world in isolation

Searching out
Reaching out
Reaching
To understand the unrest
The unrest is growing
Between our differing ends

Emerald thoughts flow through your consciousness
Immune to light
Shiny visions of what you thought
Illuminating what you thought
Immunity is building
And learning to live

"Viper King"

Venomous
By design
Lying idle
Biding time
Until the bitter end
A treason ridden king

Bore into the night
Underneath the stars
The serpent's hide
Met the end

"The Night And The Silent Water"

Underwater world of memories
Sitting in the dark
memory ocean
Faint flickering
I'm watching from the shadows

White candle light
Smiling in the midst of the darkest water
Nothing seems to penetrate me
Still I am entranced

Beyond the night
Underneath the stars
The silent water
Swallows me and makes me forget
All my heavy heart desires

Black liquid like snow
Cold liquid like ice
Sits frozen in time
And nowhere to lay

Nothing seems to penetrate me
Still I am entranced

Beyond the night
Underneath the stars
The silent water
Swallows me and makes me forget
All my heavy heart desires

"Blackwater Park"

Set to a commercial song

The cogs in the hay bogs
What can I say?
The baying of the baying of the baying of the rain
I'm into the ground

Nothing seems to penetrate me
Still I am entranced

"Beneath The Night"

There's a truth in these words
There's a truth in these dreams
There's a truth with living things
There's a truth with water
There's a truth with breathing
There's a truth with knowing

There's a conflict tearing me apart
There's a peace I'm searching
There's a pain I'm rejoicing

I erase myself to save myself
I wake up to be whole again

"Transcending Time"

Up until recently I've been alone
On this solitary path I follow
No friend or witness
I have gone and sought to understand

Even as I write this I am reaching for the unknown
And I blend with the world of familiar

I meet with the spirits of peace
And we blend with the world of familiar

I meet with the spirits of death
And I blend with the world of familiar

I meet with the spirits of wisdom
And I blend with the world of familiar

I am reaching for the unknown
And I can no longer fight
To live the life I once left behind

Like a child once again
With no father to guide me
And no love for me
I'm reaching for the unknown

Transcending time
I can't imagine why
Not now, not ever

I would contemplate
The loss of loved ones
For me to see them today
And it would be without consolation

I shun the path of ascension
Rather gaze forthwith at the endless
Cloud that sleeps within
While I race through the trails of history

I meet with the spirits of wisdom
And they whisper
Of my final demise
While I linger in the pale moon

"Age Of Fear"

Falling through pages of research
I keep your name along for the ride

Pale dogs and demigods
Captured in their conflagration
Of irrational thoughts and cries

Beneath a mercy or a patience
I must travel as far as I can to find my way

Sleeping with fear
As the echo of ages
Pursuing a dream that no longer survives

Still days I
