"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night]

[Arhys:]
As fearless leader of the free Maritimes
With the Empire burning
Still life pushes on
As his children seek to understand

How the sudden appearance
Of their own writing
Is a sign of strength

Yet another reason to stay

Still searching
To find my home here
Where I began to live
And left behind all my woes

[Xander:]
As fearless father of three
With the security of a questioned
And the peace of mind
We never thought we'd meet

Now it's time for you to find your place
On our old streets we baying to our kin
For love and peace we're gonna march
To the moon

We rise, light our way
I'll make my way

Standing by is a burden to all
We gather there depends on us
It's a burden to have my way

There's a reason now I see
The reason I've been searching for
My story against the wall
Sights and needs push me to my limits

[Arabelle:]
As fearless leader of the free Maritimes
With the world at his side
Of who we are today
There's a need for us to fight
There's a truth in his words
There's a message we can see

When life begins taking turns
When life becomes pretension
It's a time of war
In the blink of an eye

[Arabelle:]
Lead the way into freedom
Into liberation

[Faythe:]
Our man
We hold him here by the hand
Of our freedom
He's the man who's more than welcome

[Daryus:]
Our brother
We hold him here by the hand
Of our freedom
He's the man who's more than welcome

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden inside
Open wounds hidden under my skin

Pain is real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Staring at me crying

[CHORUS]
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I sever myself from the world
and shut down completely
All alone in my own living hell
overcome with irrational fear

Under the weight of the world on my chest
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath
Tell me I got out of here
I tell him I got out of here

Running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

"The Looking Glass"

I would not expect you felt unnoticed and ignored
Better to rise above the clouds Then be a stranger in the crowd
All that you protected doesn’t matter anymore
Rather be stripped of all your pride
Than watch your dreams be cast aside

You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying stardom
Singing your own praise

You live without shame
you’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You are not content with covering up your own indiscretions
They always lie beneath the surface

You are covered in dust
Soiling your bed linens with your misdeeds
And burdened with losing loved ones
Lying on the folding chair

And not getting away
It's a burden you never could wish on your enemy
Yet it weighs heavy with every fiber

You are feeling abandoned and down
Waiting for a new adventure
Yet every puff of wind that drifts across my thin Nair
Will bury her in the ground

She is waiting for an ocean of sorrow
Yet she waits for a new adventure
Tells me she wants me to
She could be waiting for hours
A cancer bedeopard tears my heart open wide
She is waiting for a new adventure
Yet she waits for a new adventure
Yet she waits for a new adventure
Yet she waits for a new adventure
