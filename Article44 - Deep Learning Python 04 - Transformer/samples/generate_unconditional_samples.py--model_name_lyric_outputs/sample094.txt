Watching him from the other side
Watching patience die with him
Watching eternity lapse
Watching faith in despair
Watching eternity lapse
Watching life lapse
Watching
Our frail frame acting as a shield
Bleeding us to death
We are wearers blood, but we are also inspired
We send our dead ahead of yearning
To breathe and to learn
Death is not the answer unless we believe it is the answer

Our souls are fueled by hate but awake by virtue
Self conscious through reflexive aggression
Sparked by inner calm
Latexed by blackened anger

Soul deflated by virtue of aging
Soul deflated by virtue of aging

Feeding on chaos
Soul deflated by virtue of aging
Soul deflated by virtue of aging

Soul deflated
(breathes an ocean of change)
(breathes an ocean of change)

(breathes an ocean of change)
(breathes an ocean of change)

"Death Whispered A Lullaby"

Out on the road there are fireflies circling
Deep in the woods, where the lost souls hide
Over the hill there are men returning
Trying to find some peace of mind

Sleep my child

Under the fog there are shadows moving
Don't be afraid, hold my hand
Into the dark there are eyelids closing
Buried alive in depths of sorrow

Sleep my child

Speak to me now and the world will crumble
Open a door and the moon will fall
All of your life, all your memories
Go to your dreams again

Sleep my child

"Closure"

Heal myself-a feather on my heart
Look inside-there never was a start
Peel myself-dispose of severed skin
All subsides-around me and within

There's nothing painful in this
There's no upheaval
Redemption for my pathway lost

<|endoftext|>

"Closure"

To feel the earth under my feet
To have the sun glare behind me
Received with open arms by a believer
Disrupted in its fulcrum
Effect upon my psyche

there's no turning back
On this chapter
The sea of fireflies have my back
As I drive on
Through the dusty barren skies
The emerald tip past our once secure ways
Through the cheery white light of our modern our driven by words.

"Six Chords That Made A Million"

Six of a kind
That is to say,
"Where are we now?"

There's an ivory tower right in the center
Voices grow on the moon
Counting...

5 Chords that made a million

"The Throat Of Winter"

"Blackened Aspect"

One voice, and severed body
Speaking from the heart of this disease

The flesh is torn to shreds
The river stains to the touch
Souls begin to die
Drained of hope
And cold shudder at the mention
Mistaken for a sign of strength

Another voice and severed body
Speaking from the heart of this disease

FADE

Under NIGHTMARCH

Stay the eye of the storm
Stay the eye of the storm

FERENCE
Beating wings of hatred
Bleeding her with fire
Take the morning stars for granted
Nothing seems to penetrate
Force is channeling the anger

Power is passing through unseen
Like a blind man in a maze
Wherever I go astray
I will always remain

You can glance the other way
Or you can look it in the eye
You can see the difference
Let the sweat drip down your face

The astray thoughts move like waves
Not a flicker of an eye
While the bold, bold thought begins to take hold
You are blind as all are

FADE

Under NIGHTMARCH

Stay the eye of the storm
Stay the eye of the storm

FERENCE
Beating wings of hatred
Bleeding her with fire
Take the morning stars for granted
Nothing seems to penetrate
Force is channeling the anger

Power is passing through unseen
Like a blind man in a maze
Wherever I go astray
I will always remain

"My Hurt Soul"

A pharaoh
Sitting in his garden
Noble thoughts flowflower
A pharaoh sows his new mystery

He doesn't know what his aim is
He's lost his way
