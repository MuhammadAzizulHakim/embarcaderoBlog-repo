======================================== SAMPLE 25 ========================================
The poor fellow has eaten too long
The poison's on his skin

Gives you energy
Grants you purpose
To reap the harvest
You stare into the void
Moonlight caressing a dying soul

You thrive in the darkness
While the weaker will suffer
Youufactur
You endure the light
As I awoke from my sleep

Outside the chill of night hangs over me
As the lantern guides the dying dusk
Spinning past inside the ghost of a falling candle
And the final sound

"Hours Of Wealth"

Found a way to rid myself clean of pain
And the fever that's been haunting me
Has gone away

I try to shut it out
When it calms me down
And thinks I've slipped
Down a not so pleasant place

Even when I feel good
There's still something that I have to hide
I find that I have to hide in order to survive
And the story that surrounds me never seems to slow down
As I`m finally let out

I'm getting nowhere
And my life will take a sudden turn
Junk mail and old clocks
 Shopping for roomies

I met the face on the train today
It seemed to me to be in distress
I called the Doctor
He`d be calling me back

As the water started to boil
A cloud appeared outside my window
I knew the voice of my mind
Call me back

"Patterns In The Ivy 2"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]
As you can see from the way she talks
Inherit the beauty and the doubt
So carry on keep me pure

When will this bitter war end?
When will the last war be over?

We know better
The lies behind these eyes

It's become a religion
I’ve become a warrior
Fighting for my pride
And my life
On this perilous road
I’ve taken more than I can bear

There's a fate that I cannot avoid
I’ve taken life too far
And here I am the burden lies
For any soldier looking to the brave

I am no longer a prisoner of flesh
I’ve taken life too far
And here I am the new normal

"Blackwater Park"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Faythe:]
Should I fall for his ways?
How many times must he remember
That I have sacrificed more than I am worth

Bloodshed and fires burning
By the hundreds
It is the envy of me
Will he ever see the red,
Red faced once again

[Arabelle:]
You must not have been waiting for that
I was waiting for you very

[Daryus:]
I didn’tasie your respect
Deep down
You thought that I’ve done for you
What I willing give you up
And let you go
Turning back now
What I wanted and what I need
Is you back it's worth
I must keep my promises to you and I'm loving this
EXTRA INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night
[Daryus:]
If I do, he will surely seek my sympathy
And anger could be justified
as I repent and restore my sanity

[Gabriel:]
How dare you step inside my home!
My shelter will be razed
and my son will never see him again
These things don't add up

It's time you made a change
Look in my eyes
and tell me that we belong together
I’ll make you my home run king

"Moment Of Betrayal"

[EXT. Heavens' Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Gabriel:]
Faith sent me to find you
I trust in you to be your father's son
No surprise here
I’ve gone to war too scared
To find you's true colors
this sudden storm of a life
was never your mother's or your father's
dream

But I feel I must go
to war again
Before I realize it
I will lose my voice, my sense of smell, my whole sense of self

I’ve made a terrible mistake
I’ve exposed it all again

I’ve taken my time and gone
right through the vice
It's betrayal that is my end-manifestation

I’ve forgiven you many times
but none have been as painful
forgiving and forgiving as this
understanding
you've done
