======================================== SAMPLE 37 ========================================
Only a few years ago
I was waiting for a new adventure
A beautiful young man
Compelled to his last
To explore forgotten waters
By his side
Among the rarest of forests
His body lying still
Still in the making

Now that we may have reached the turning stone
Our hope stands no chance of stopping
Tomorrow's youth and comfort

Behind closed eyes we can surely remember
The way she smiled at me
One of her secrets
I treasure now

"Heart in Hand"

"It's simply woeful. Yuck!"
"Who the hell are you?"
[Quote from "Skrot-Nisse" by Jan Lööf]

Out of an ivory mist
Rotten by the seasons
And spewing forth an ocean of regrets
All the victims of a wish
None other than my beloved

The true heart of man
A harlot of God upon the earth

The sliding scale takes us further
When beyond all reason
Our desires have failed us
And further rejecting our savior

Yuck!

When I'm down
The victim of a fleeting lapse
The gallows are my shelter
A place where I can call on him
When I can't escape from this bitterness

There's a passage of fire on my wall
Fire on my wall and under my skin
Throne of secrecy therewith

Blind devotion adorn my eyes
Staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sound
Like a sickly green light

"Pale Blue Dot"

So far is away so short
From a moment of doubt

A floating dream
Awakens inside of a▬▬▬▬▬▬
The coldness of reality
Wings at me from all over

I'll never want again
Addressing myself to all of you

It's not too late for her to wish away
You looking so much into her eyes
And it's not too late for me to wish away

Beyond the pale blue Dot's gone
The coldness of reality
Awakens inside of a▬▬▬▬▬▬
The coldness of reality
Awakens inside of a▬▬▬▬▬▬

"Bottomless Tort"

I made a poor choice
That young soul thereforcrueltyitizes love
Even when it's justified
The Torture Ground is a sacred place
Where sacrificed sons of contentment
are smothered
Even in the face of evil

Under torture and abuse
Many a boy would die
But at the bottom of the drink
Were it not for the faith I had instilled

Bottomless torture
A belief has thrived
In the boy's ability to see
through the torture

So this sorrow is my blood
It feeds into the fear that holds me

Bottomless torment
My blood is flowing to the fire
That gives life to anyone
who tampers
It gives dignity to anyone
Who tampers

Bottomless torment
My blood is flowing to the fire
That gives life to anyone
who tampers
It gives dignity to anyone who tampers

"Don't Hate Me"

A revelation for the willing cultivator
A way to rid himself of shame
and get rid of pain

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so glad you're here
I come to find you
Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so glad you're here
I come to find you
Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I know you well
I come to find you
Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I know you well

"Chloroform"

Little retrograde, wonder where you are
Another motorcade, under radar
A boy in borrowed clothes, knows he is a girl
Shards of light come down, stillness in the air
Big sleeper, your deeper, too deep for me

You're miles from home
You're miles from home
You're miles from home
You're miles from home

Lighting up a dream, should'vepacked their head with pain
They left me in borrowed clothes
Stretching for miles, touching their wheels

"Hex Omega"

Two years realize nothing ever happens
Three hundred and eighty-six are still too far away

Two and a half hours in the store
They tell me how to start a new life
They show me one that will last
And how to fix a
