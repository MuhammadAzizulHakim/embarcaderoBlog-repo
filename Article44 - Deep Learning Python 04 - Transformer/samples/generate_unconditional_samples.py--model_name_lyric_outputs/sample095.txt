All your questions are answered now
Just step inside

Take a look at me
Feeling alone and insignificant
I am Count Vertigo

Why can't we say no when there's so much wrong with us?
Our suffering and death are my own making

If there's one thing I know
No-one can do for us
It's love at all costs

No one is more wicked than I
And she I am
Angels fall on innocent children
Only God can save us all

[Chant:]
 "That bitterness inside
Isn't helping me break down
Feelings of hatred running all through me
Still reeling from my own demons
Still reeling from my own demons
And hating on me
And hating on him
It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you
I'm trying to find my voice
Liar, lawyer, father
Just let me say this, don't whisper
All my questions answered
Just step inside

Under a loving parent
There's a sickness in us all
Yeah, you've got to understand
It's almost like we shun you
It's almost as if we don't go out of our way
To lend a helping hand
To those who may need it the most

It's time for a change
There's no doubting its beauty
There's no doubting its beauty

[Chant:]
 "It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you
We're learning from mistakes...
There's a certain nobility in your loving father

There's a certain arrogance in adoptive brothers and sisters
And conceit on the part of those who love them
And dishonor with our bloodstained eyes

[Ramblings:]
"Anthony Lee Billings"

"He was my life back then
Everything about him remains true in our family today
From his loving father's eyes

He was always my father's secret love
He's forgiven us all of this sin
The end for the day arrogant and vindictive
Don't think you hear me today
Sir can you hear me?

He's forgiven us all of this sin
We came to accept the end
And now it's time for the can't-miss turn

You were my life back then
Everything about him remains true in our family today
From his loving father's eyes

He was my life back then
Everything about him remains true in our family today
From his loving father's eyes

Waiting days
Locked in the path of Exodus
Just to find out what will be
A secure desert beckons

Locked in the path of the flood

Blinded by a light
Through a sprinkle
By a miracle
Found a way
To turn back the prophet
Turning his back on mankind

"Dialogue Wall"

Pray for help
Find me what I am trying to do

Wash my hands of regret
Come clean
My anger, my anger
Never the passion to face another day

Once called upon
Through love in solitude
To harness the power of anger
To divide the soul
Into thoughts and ideas
I'm consumed

I’ll make a sacrifice
To end this pain
But I can’t keep myself together
When love has failed me

And anger my only hope
My only refuge
Am I not the man I am meant to be?

Blinded by a light
Through a sprinkle
By a miracle
Found a way
To turn back the prophet
Turning his back on mankind

"The Grand Conjuration"

Majesty
Faithful me
Pour yourself
Into me

Wash your hands of regret
Come clean
My anger, my anger
Never the passion to face another day

Until I can no longer face this on my own
Until love has failed me
And anger my only refuge
I’ve taken that strength away
