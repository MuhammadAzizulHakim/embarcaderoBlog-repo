Behind closed eyes
some mystic
understands the thoughts
and behavior
of a
woman

lady
trust

Could read between the
lives
bleeding
as ghosts of a
survival overtone
this highly guarded secret
memory

IDEFEND

As a child she was considered somewhat odd
unlikeable
because of her height and other attributes
but today he is easily recognized
he is one of us

Now they see it all from his eyes
Look they may have found it all
from the moment he stood over me
at the bottom of the stairs

"I get up much easier with wisdom and foresight
than with regret and self-indulgent
looks of admiration."
"I have come much closer to giving
up"
to tragedy or grace,
been much more open with me,
been more forgiving and open
than I was with my brothers and fathers
and I will never forget
at that moment courage and judgement had
won her the war
at a time when our lives
still seemed so fragile
I sprang from my own tragic episode
and called her up once more
to let her know
everything was fine
and that I would never hurt her.

There was a storm on the way
and I waved a goodbye that brought tears to my eyes
and she knew it was me
and she had lost in her surprise
a lifetime of war and strife

She was alone with a friend and she had an answer inhered in her voice
and she said
her name
and invited him over to her home
because her soul had lost its enigma
and as the years went by
rushed on she would recall him
and he would pass the weight
of her life back to him

As a child she struggled to understand
the gravity of his words
and in her teenage years she would tear his hand free
to seek guidance in her ways
new ambitions and visions
and though they might seem insignificant today
he is believed by many as the man who changed her life

She had lost her sight
at the age of sixteen
found her beauty in her music
breathed a rain of sorrows over the years
and by the time she had turned 28
had turned her youth all but done
her
power over her mind
now alone she could not recall
her dark days
and now she could not remember
her dark days

As a girl she struggled to understand
the gravity of his words
and in her teenage years she would tear his hand free
to seek guidance in her ways
new ambitions and visions
and though they might seem insignificant today
he is believed by many as the man who changed her life

Attention starts dimpling radar images
at the age of 7
It is the dawning of a nameless man
The image that seemed so clear to everyone
was soon taken away from under us
And all of us become one mind
Content to let our fate decide

Once all of us become one mind
everything about this new world order
will fade away

"The X Aspect"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night]

[Arhys:]
As fearless leader of the X-wing
On a quest to give their son a place
He's taken so many lives
Yet still so much remains to be learned

Old X-wing? How it always burns inside
I remember the warrior's pride
As he faced the enemy down
I thought about abandoning our son

As his name rose that night
I saw her running through the woods
A thorn in her side, a reason to regret

It's only been a matter of moments
The X Aspect, father and son
Together wept for our savior

As her story touched the core of our hearts
And all of us shed a tear
Those moments are still ours

As her story touched the core of our hearts
And all of us shed a tear
