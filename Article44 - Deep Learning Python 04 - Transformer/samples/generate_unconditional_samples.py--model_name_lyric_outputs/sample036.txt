======================================== SAMPLE 36 ========================================
Of the few times I've had the nerve to say something
I miss the way you painted me
I wish you could see me now
Turning away as though frightened

Innocence faded
the mirror falls behind you
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
And smiled at me in awe
I felt the source of your fame

When I'm down I hide away from the sun
When I can't be trusted I turn to faith
Give me something new
Give me something new
You've done the math
You know the answers
You're the man

[Henry Rollins:]
If I heard
You were on the cover I'd throw a fit
But if I just stared into his dark recesses
I don't know what I'd find

Innocence faded
the mirror falls behind you
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
And smiled at you in awe
I felt the source of your fame

When I'm down I hide away from the sun
When I can't be trusted I turn to faith
Give me something new
Give me something new
You've done the math
You know the answers
You're the man

"Face Of Melinda"

By the turnstile beckons a damsel fair
The face of Melinda neath blackened hair
Which was made of rose gold

And mother Newman was waving a goodbye
And clutching her child
In a motionless gesture was forgivable
Trying to steel her against his will

But face of Melinda
Black as holes, but never blackest of them
And mother is dead
I imagine her sighing in relief

And I know what they want to say
Say they tried, never of regret
But never could hold her in sympathy
Even when they saw her on the cover

"Let me help you find your way home?"
"That's not how it is"
"Don't turn your back on anyone."
"Do not tremble as I have done"
"Do not try to control your destiny"
"Everything is destiny"
"I have given you everything"
"I will give you everything"

And I know what they want to say
Say they tried, never of regret
But never could hold her in sympathy

I remember a time when I Liquid ate his pride
Out of my chest
I of course turned away as well
As I would have liked
But now I know what they all want to say
Say they tried, never of regret
But never could hold her in sympathy

My sweet Melinda
My love for you never fading
No more threatening
She would not dare to ask me

I give you what you need
I am not afraid
My love for you never fading
No more threats
She would not dare to ask me

"Sleeping Giant"

[Instrumental]

After wept for a while
The loneliness of finding
And starting again
The desire to be away from you

It's not like that
Sprawling everywhere
No one I know still
Knowing what to say
I'll never know you

[Sleeping giant:]
You're sleeping giant
It's getting dark more than today
Your dreams are crumbling, so much uncertainty
What is it that you worry about?

[Denial:]
The loneliness of finding
And starting again
Sightsabling your way through all your pain
Sounds like a betrayal of trust
Carries out a course of action
Trust me take it back

[Self-pitying Giant:]
You're really hurting
Justify denials like these
Keep your pride sacred
And hold your compassion open
And don't judge or critique

[Denial:]
The loneliness of finding
And starting again
Sightsabling your way through all your pain
Sounds like a betrayal of trust
Carries out a course of action
Trust me take it back

"Deliverance"

A heartbeat away from you, we're still one
Heart still beating for one more

Promises made, cries of despair
Waiting for a new beginning
Desperate to seize control

Yet another sign of weakness
Another sign of strength

Run - swim - fly
