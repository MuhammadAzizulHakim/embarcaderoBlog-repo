======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================
Don't moan
Don't sigh
Breathe
Black mist is falling on all of us
It's raining, raining terrible rain
We can't seem to reach the roof to Rite of Winter
All of our hopes have been dashed

Don't moan
Don't sigh
Don't breathe

"The Shattered Fortress"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]
As fearless and fearless as we come, I'm told
You're bound to know the proudest secret of all
Ildus won't stand still
His might alone will raise the dead
Brother may tell them what
The truth will rain down]

[Dionys:]
On the threshold of his home - where he swore to go - the mighty are found
[Xander:]
Forty-six soldiers, all killed
There's a story in their homes
It reads, "The hero's going to be found".
He'll be buried with dignity
Standing beside us

There's a vision going, "Tie it loose".
There'll be no turning back
No matter what

The moment he faced me
His face lit up
His gaze said, "This is the destiny of your soul".
You can look that bright now
An early light up into the still
But it's fading slowly

You have to know the truth
The moment he faced me
My face lit up
His coat began to turn
As if it had been a surprise

I never expected that
My soul had this much to lose
I never expected that so precious

"Brother, Tristan and His Devil Fists"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Faythe:]
They're going to have to kill me now
For what I've done
I'm bound to say
This is nothing but a betrayal
And I'll be waiting for no one

What went wrong?
What have I done?
Is it over?

[Arabelle:]

For someone like you
Who's lost all ambition
This is no accident

Noticing all of her love
And learning from her mistakes

[Nafaryus:]

What went wrong?
What have I done?
Is it over?

[Arabelle:]

I'm sorry for what I have done
But I do feel that I must
Open up my eyes
And ask myself
How I feel I'm not the same

[Narrator:]

After all that
They found hard to believe
His kingdom has been tattered
and he'll never truly return

How can I feel abandoned even when his children
have come to me
And still I give them hope
Even when their dreams are shattered
I show them love again
Not through heroes
But through true believers

[Denis:]

Brace yourself
for the memory of tomorrow

[Faythe:]

I am bent, stained and bruised
Many years have passed
Since I stood upon you
And left my life behind

I am almost done now
With what little we have left
And where we will move in the years to come
But can't stop you
Just don't expect what you deserve

[Denis:]

I will not rest until you're begging me to
Be myself
I am almost done now
With what little we have left
And where we will move in the years to come
But can't stop you
Just don't expect what you deserve

[Narrator:]

Like a candle's dying flame
With questions that never go unanswered

Will innocence die before God can answer
Will God know what is really right
And can we be sure that what we are rejecting is simply God's will?

In a deafening silence
We dare not speak
And are silenced by deafening silence
For many years
Until one day I stopped caring and began to forget

I have stopped caring
And will give all of my heart to save those few
That are left behind

So quiet and unafraid
I am leaving now
With a message that will keep my silence from ever reaching him

"Even Less (Full Version)"

A body is washed up on a Norfolk beach
He was a friend that I could not reach
He thought I was cold but I know now
Saying how I want to live is no longer enough for me
And I no longer feel I belong in these walls

When I'm down I hide away from the sun
And when I'm up I fight the fear within me
When I'm right I shine and I can't stop
