======================================== SAMPLE 75 ========================================
This is nothing but dreaming
We are living in a world of
Pills and chloroform

Outside the window I see a washed out moon
Along the shoreline I shall find comfort
And maybe a dream that once
Was hers

"When Your Sun Scratchethink"

A warning cull from a dream
Voice grows from the trees
and the insects fly
Along with the words stuck in my mind
It is culled from a nightmare
And left in my blood

When my sun scratchethink
And I am assassinated
I take my own life as a sign
Of sorts

My blood forked over over the moon
And sent me fleeing
As all the dreams I've had
All are lost in the falling snow

"Deadwing Wonderland"

This is what I would have you believe
If I were you I'd call you
It is what it would have me believe
If I were you I'd call you
It's what it would have me believe

Twisted love in love with the moon above
And hidden under aite's coat of arms
The tide would turn here and there
As far as I could see

I suffocate under this heavy pillow
She can't keep her mouth shut
He's holding back on the gold
And she's starving to death

Every wretched dream
I have inside my
Heart burning for the son and the father
As I'm being undone by desire
It is pouring out to find me

Gotta divide it all right in two right in the center
Right in two right in the center
Right in two right in the center
Right in two right in the center
Right in two right in the center
Right in two right in the center
Right in two right in the center
Right..."

So divide it all right in two right in the center
Right in two right in the center
Right in two right in the center
Right in two right in the centers
Right in two right in the Capitals land
Right in two right in Game 6

"Lost Not Forgotten"

This world is not my own
This world is not mine
And sometimes I feel the sting
And the anguish in my heart
So Iâ€™m asking myself
What have I done?
What have I done?

Be patient (be patient)
Step through the roof
For the love of waiting
Be patient (be patient)

If I let you down
You would be squaring off against me
What have I done?
What have I done?

Step through the roof
For the love of waiting
Be patient (be patient)
Step through the roof
For the love of waiting

"This Is Kept Behind"

Still it burns deep in my chest
Still it burns deep in my chest

The heavy breathing stills the disease in me
The skin is burning lingering emotions
Back home in my head
Something has gone awry
The scratching of the ear
Something went wrong.

The call for assistance stills the rage within me
The look of trepidation yet it remains
I'm reminding myself of something
There's something wrong here
Just below the surface, just below the level of consciousness
I'm reminding myself of something
There's something wrong here
Just below the surface, just below the level of consciousness

The call for help stills the message in me

Just below the surface, just below the level of consciousness
I'm reminding myself of something

Just below the surface, just below the line
