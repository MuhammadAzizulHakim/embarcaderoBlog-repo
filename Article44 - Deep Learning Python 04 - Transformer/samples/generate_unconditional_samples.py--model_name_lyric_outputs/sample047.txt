"Blurring Lines"

This is my attempt at a dark novel
Cusp of a new age, borderline insane
Driven in and begging for more
One of a kind, mind debris
Avoidance at all costs
A conscious design
To keep me sane

This is my blood flow
This is my breathing
This is my mind
This is my writing

This is my writing
Something has to give
I can't seem to shake this feeling
You're my peace of mind, but not enough
I'm trying to find my way back home
Something has to give
I can't seem to shake this feeling
You're my peace of mind, but not enough
I'm trying to find my way back home

This is my writing
Something has to give
I can't seem to shake this feeling
You're my peace of mind, but not enough
I'm trying to find my way back home
Although I can't seem to get out, I'm trying to find my way back home

"Miracle"

It was September, 1969.
The air was thick and heavy with clouds surrounding me
and on either shore I could see the bleachers breaking
Down.
I don't recall how I got so high
And on either shore I was almost empty

I think that something`s been haunting her dreams
and that might have been the catalyst
but she's never told anyone
about this

jaded into temptation
now she's swallowed the poison
woman oh witch of lust
who is almost always
too scared to step out of her misery

she never told a friend how
She survived the Manson phenomenon
and never looked back
or she would betray her
love to anyone
now she's risen up again
was it really worth it?

It's a mystery to me
It's a mystery to you
It's a mystery to me
It's a mystery to you

Just when I thought I believed in you
And just when I thought I believed in you
Nothing can hold me together
this is when I felt most at ease
The glass prison which once held me is now gone
ading me into temptation
now she wishes she could see
My flaunting of our unbreakable code
It's no longer enough to make me feel good
She'll need to break me down.
Just ask myself

Has this world gone too far?
Is there something I can do to make it go away?
If I take too long
to realize that my behavior
has adversely affected me throughout my life
then I'm willing to die

Even as I write this
I can see the writing on my body
said that my behavior
has adversely impacted me throughout my life
and I'm willing to die

Even as I write this
I can see the writing on my body
said that my behavior
has adversely impacted me throughout my life
and I'm willing to die

"Lips Of Ashes"

Paralysed
For the rest of my days
I collect pieces of clay
And burn them
For the Ashes I swore tospread

Pull me down again
And let me be
Again

I'm paralyzed
I'm in a hole
I need a voice, a way to TortuouslyTell me why
I'm staring back, refusing to move

I'm sitting on the ceiling
Numb
Faint
Suddenly
I'm awake
The building comes down.
My isolation fever is high
I'm staring right back.

Pull me down again
And let me be
Again

I'm paralyzed
I'm in a hole
I need a voice, a way to TortuouslyTell me why
I'm staring back, refusing to move
I'm sitting on the ceiling
Numb
Faint
Suddenly
I'm awake
The building comes down.
My isolation fever is high
I'm staring right back.

Pull me down again
And let me be
Again

I'm paralyzed
I'm in a hole
I need a voice, a way to TortuouslyTell me why
I'm staring back, refusing to move
I'm sitting on the ceiling

Weak
Numb
Faint
Suddenly
I'm awake
The building comes down.
Our isolation fever is high
I'm staring right back.

Pull me down again
And let me be
