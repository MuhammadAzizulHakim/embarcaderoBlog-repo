======================================== SAMPLE 80 ========================================
Only forth we viper
Hoping we can free them all
Nothing more shall remain

In witness I'm the one who details
My judgement is judge of this

I'm the one
With jury duty now ends
Turn and go left

Try to make sense of this
When is the word
Only forth
And when is the end

Nothing though we think
It may prove
The truth of our lives

At times the guilt and the innocence
Can bury the scars
Cold sweat cover the grave
While hope will survive
Just the guilt and the innocence

Viper venom, snare of the tail
Gasping for another breath

Neither wind nor sky
Can neutral light bring us back

Shadowed face, speaking of long lost liberty
He's addressed us all here
Just another name to lay upon a memory

In the absence of compassion and reason
We shun this edge of our hearts
And find it increasingly hard to hang

Swept away with the morning mist
Through the holes in my hands
And with the dawning of a new day

There's nothing sacred
We hollow life into a few dreams
And hold our "long lost liberty" a reality check
It's all an endless dance

Nothing sacred
We hollow life into a few dreams
And hold our "long lost liberty" a reality check
It's all an endless dance

"Up The Downstair"

Sleep
Until the colours dissolve
Leave the dream to rain-soak forever
In blessed moments
Viewed from trains of half-truths

Monuments burn into moments
Up into other worlds
Other ascensions
Without deep sorrow to endure

Black Sunday of sleep
Open for small angel escapes
Moved by buildings to tears
They week in the rain
Am I at home?
Am I in heaven?
Gentle Architecture

"Small Fish"

The first thing that I saw as,
the fisherman smiled at me
Were empty people dressed in grey,
floating out to sea
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
The small fish gave a cry

The next thing that I saw as,
things were fading fast
Were dreams of children's laughter,
smouldering to dust
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
The small fish gave a cry

The last thing that I saw as, my life passed by
Were fields of empty people, laying down to die
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
To watch the burning sky.

"Fadeaway"

I sat in the room with a view
The girl in the photograph knew
Can't you see?
Why is she laughing at me?

I stumbled through the dark unaware
The face in the hall isn't there
Tomorrow has gone
Where do the voices come from?

Watching her now I forgot all I'd said
And found myself staring back
Faint shadows crawling on the silk
My breath was in a cloud
But I... I can't see the reason

She's lost her looks for me
In the mirror she's given me
Took my hand and wept

I slipped away from her forever
Fading guilt reeling from my heart
I wished she could be there for me
But she's gone away
To seek her innocence in cold blood
The mirror she's passed on to this day

I'm getting feelings again
I'm getting feelings again
And my mind is racing
Swimming in the past
I'm getting feelings again
And my mind is racing

She was counting life lessons learned
With a view to the night
She said she always wakes me from the dead
Carry my ashes
To remember her for all the days I'll lie still

I'm getting feelings again
I'm getting feelings again
And my mind is racing
Swimming in the past
I'm getting feelings again
And my mind is racing

<|endoftext|>

"She's Dying"

The silence of her weeping voice
Sits at her funeral pyre

The air is still so warm
With the ashes scattered on the white stone
Where once I fell
Cast off my crown
And comforted empty promises deep in deep fear

It was the worst night of my life
A distant oasis
She wished I still celebrated her loss
And claimed her true beauty
from the fire in her hand

I'm getting feelings again
I'm getting feelings again
And my mind is racing
Swimming
