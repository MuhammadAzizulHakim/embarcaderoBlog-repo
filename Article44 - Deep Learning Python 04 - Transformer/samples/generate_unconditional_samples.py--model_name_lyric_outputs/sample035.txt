And watch their dire omen
"' matchup "

I can't see where this story ends

Or what it may conclude

Either way, we go watching
While our children will grow up

Life with Nicholas Cage
Spin a few short years
And he'll be schooled as the new king

Life with Nicholas Cage
Spin a few years and he'll be king

Nicholas Cage
Has become the new king
Of this earthly home
He'll be the first to know

Live on forever Nicholas
Cage will be left a shattered stone
Hundreds of believers at large
Who will flock to his cause

Nicholas Cage
Our savior has come to make him whole
He'll be waving goodbye
To his fellow man
He'll be dying under hisurnal skies

As a boy he was considered just a wanted person
But as a man he's changed and traveled
He's broken and twisted man
Now we can't seem to balance
He's lost in eternity

Nicholas Cage

"Known Concern"

Prince of lies
With his secrets all on ice
He works himself into madness
Giving his all for the cause

Always the worst interest of my life
I'm afraid to be free
I'm afraid to be young and blind

I may never get over
Though I'll always stick to what I know
Misguided and erratic
That selfish high
I must always be the one to know
The truth always Rings Traded

For too long has been barred
The path of self-denial
Begged on constantly
For the pride to slip away

Admitting guilt
Saying there was a disagreement
There's a truth in admitting that
There's no such thing as "truth"
No matter how hard I try

I could tell you everything
And still you'd still understand
But for the grace to flow between us
So hold the flame between us 'til your heart's content

I know I'm not the same as you
It's almost like a stepping stone
But there's a way
I could tell you everything
And still you'd still understand
But for the grace to flow between us
So hold the flame between us
Our grace to flow

"Persephone"

A beloved name inside my heart
A beloved name inside my head

She was blocked out handsomely
By the death penalty we believed
Vowing to live the life we never knew
She would be defenseless
In the light of this knowledge, she reared back
Feeling somewhat sad

[Henry Rollins:]
If I die tomorrow the memory fades away
From a fleeting memory
That shouldered away
Asphyxiate the vices and the woes
Dripping from a wealth of sins
Divine vengeance for the sins of fathers

Persephone was born in Ravenskill
But became a devout Hermetic
Constant mystic
By her divinity she could not pull herself out
This was evident when observing her
Deliverance came knocking on her door

[Henry Rollins:]
You are the rotted image that ever sleeps
A hopeless and unloving crop of dust within a memory
That churns up and drowns the senses
Asphyxiate the vices and the woes
Dripping from a wealth of sins
Divine vengeance for the sins of fathers

Persephone was born in Ravenskill
But became a devout Hermetic
Constant mystic
By her divinity she could not pull himself out
This was evident when observing her
Deliverance came knocking on her door

[Henry Rollins:]

[Deliverance]:
Addicted to the game
Nothing divine is left unmentioned

[Daryus:]
Brace yourself my brother
Before we head back home we must first cleanse our souls
Otherwise we will never be Here, Soul is Fat Cook

"The Forest Of October"

The memories that now rests in this forest
Forever hesitating
Will soon be gone
When she will know
Who we are
And the days will come

Call me back
When the days are late
Will she feel the pain youâ€™ve labeled as a danger
Call me back with a kiss

And the memories that now rests in this forest
Forever hesitating
Will soon be gone
When she will know
Who we are
And the days will come
When she will marvel at your beauty

Darkness above and darkness below
Don't dismiss the possibility
Call me back
With a kiss

Darkness above and darkness below
Don't dismiss the possibility

Sever yourself
Avoid contact with situations outside your control
Mobilize through
