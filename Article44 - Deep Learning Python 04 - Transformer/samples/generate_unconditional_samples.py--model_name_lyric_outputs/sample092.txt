"Scarred"

We lost all sense of wonder
(Bring it back for me to watch, Watch where I'm going
Watching through my eyes again

Once seen alone with my life on my hands
Captured in a moment of weakness
I've changed forever more

This feeling
Always present in my mind
Way out of reach

Sometimes I feel like I'm in danger
This feeling
Always present in my mind
Way out of reach

Risking all to bring about our end
(Those feelings, those tragedies)
Predictable or not, there's no turning back

Stay with me my angel I'm my own man
I'm my own man
I need not surrender
Just because you're here doesn't mean I'm gone

I can help you to your very own grave
No matter what, I know that your time is now

Listen when temptation consumes you
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't knee the demand

When I'm behind
I'm always waiting
For a new sense of adventure
(Steal from the maze, steal from the forgotten
)

I may have wasted all those years
But I can still find them in me
Through forgiving our sins

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't
But now that I've come clean
I'm free now

"Choirs of Glory"

So many years have passed
Since the sun went down
Eyes closed
And the silence of the night
Concede to change

No more circling around
Reading between the stains on my lips

I was blinded by a glory
Black as the sun
And always the darkness
Of a momentary lapse of concentration

I was blind and in a hurry
Reading between the tears on the paper
But I would say this
You are not to judge
On our behalf you are to blame
For any flaws in your life
And those flaws
Must be corrected
Otherwise you are only a danger to yourself

I was blinded by a glory
Black as the sun
And always the darkness
Of a momentary lapse of concentration

Reading between the tears on the paper
But I would say this
You are not to blame
For any flaws in your life
And those flaws
Must be corrected
Otherwise you are only a danger to yourself

Our sins make us whole
And the fabric of our world

"The Nightmare Before..."

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Daryus:]

I knew the day had come
And you were no longer a threat
So why invite me into your home again

Like a stranger with a fear I could turn him away

No amount of wind could blunt his blow
And night became a nightmare on a rare occasion

In peace
I

[INT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Daryus:]

Even when you're alone
You'll find yourself wanting more than you bargained for
Considerately

There's something that I can do for you today
Head down, lose my hold
And everything will be alright
I'm looking through your eyes

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Daryus:]

Yes, I am looking through your eyes

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Daryus:]

Alright, head down, lose my hold
Head down, lose my hold

[Arhys:]

You are shunted away like a stone
Things have got to be hella hard for you
This fight's got to be heaven's hell

[Xander:]

Well you are, than that matters
You're a stranger among us
We invite you into our home
It's not like home, it's not like home
It's not like home, it's not like home

[Faythe:]

No disrespect to him, I understand
He will always love us
And we will always fight
Because of what we have seen
From the angle of our naked eyes

[Faythe:]

It matters not at all
That is his opinion
Not me looking through her eyes

[Ensemble:]

We welcome news that deep within his soul
Will be regret
For fighting or not fighting
For who we are

[Faythe:]

Yes, we welcome the possibility
Of facing down the beast
While standing above all else

[Arabelle:]

Tonight we rejoice in the good fortune
Of all those who
