======================================== SAMPLE 43 ========================================
I've been drifting, apart from my own soul. And each time I try to open the door
I get someone different.

Strange as I seem, I never really knew.
Who I thought to be my own child,
Sweet as she seemed to be
And I thought that she would always be my daughter.

And as I've got this telephone call,
The last thing I hear is her singing "Let's Dance Dance Dance Dance".

God damn pain, what a pain.
God damn pain, what a pain.

And as I've got this telephone call,
The last thing I hear is her singing "Let's Dance Dance Dance Dance".

"2 Chords And A Million Lies"

The first two are beautiful
The third one is heavenly
The motion is still somewhere near perfect

I can't help myself
I wish this game would end
It won't work unless I change,
So I tune out the lights
And turn the music down

The music is always right
The motion is still somewhere near perfect
I can't help myself
I wish this game would end
It won't work unless I change,
So I tune out the lights
And turn the music down

The music is always right
The motion is still somewhere near perfect
I can't help myself
I wish this game would end
It won't work unless I change,
So I tune out the lights
And turn the music down

"Everything Is Not Enough"

Every day I write down a chart
Every day I draw a sketch
Every day I cry

I stand on the shoulders of giants
Fluttering across the stage
Transforming myself into a man
Singing my own praise

Every day I try to justify
As I am escorted from the pinnacle
That I have wasted my breath on wrong

Nothing ever changes
Drawn to the idea
Of myself as the savior
Of all that I've done wrong

Nothing ever changes
Drawn to the idea
Of myself as the savior
Of all that I've done wrong

I can't help myself
I wish this game would end
It won't work unless I change,
So I tune out the lights
And turn the music down

Iâ€™ve been taken for a walk through the rain
Not breathing, barely conscious
I've burned too many pages
The heat of the moment
For nearly a week
Does anyone else care?

Every day, every day
I try to justify
As I am escorted from the pinnacle
That I have wasted my breath on wrong

Nothing ever changes
Drawn to the idea
Of myself as the savior
Of all that I've done wrong
I am the chosen one
Of the born, the immortal
Of our species, so blessed

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I
Mute the traffic, ask the question, and the end is here
No sense of time
Smoke in my eyes
IKN,IJC, LAAH

The outside world keeps me constantly connected
Snaps its hand at my door
I'm drawn into its maze of problems
To start again, weSelves knows best
Start again, weventus knows best

If we embrace the challenge
It won't take much thinking
For useniks like you
to make it happen
"If we embrace the challenge"...

24 hours a day, 7 days a week
How many times must I
Live in fear
How many times must I
Work out?

I'm getting tired
I'm getting tired

All you have is you
And will vanish when you stop caring

It's raining...
Why don't you care!?

I can't breathe, I can't feel
It's raining...
Why don't you care!?

24 hours a day, 7 days a week
How many times must I
Live in fear
How many times must I
Work out?

24 hours a day, 7 days a week
How many times must I
Live in fear
How many times must I
Work out?

It's raining...
Why don't you care!?

24 hours a day, 7 days a week
How many times must I
Work in fear?
How many times must I
Work out?

"Staring Down"

I can't stare directly into the rain
But I will go down getting drier
And I can't stare directly into the rain
But I will go down getting drier

The lies ten feet tall
Have broken my fall
Welcome you all new surge
