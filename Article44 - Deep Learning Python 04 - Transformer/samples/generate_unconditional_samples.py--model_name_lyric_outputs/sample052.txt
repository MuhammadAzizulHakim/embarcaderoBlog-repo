Hip-hop icon and polar bear, Tupac Shakur, rose to stardom. He was the embodiment of black wings on a white powder demon, and adorned with his moniker of theointed one.
The infant was carried like the dove by an older hand, while the older man's a burden to be believed. He is said to have been the "king of darkness".
His mace blew a hole in the sky, blinding the explorers. They were left in a pool of radioactive water.
As their myths came undone, so too did their wisdom. They uncovered the lost secrets of man.
The secrets of man are still being held by the dragons of old, still expressed in rituals. They have revealed to us the true meaning of life, the power of love, and the need to know.
The mysteries of love are still under the control of the dragons of old. They may have revealed them to you by chance, but they have done more to stir up unrest in your hearts than any man can do.

Remember those dragons who覛親親親 said...

"O mortal, will you listen?"
"If you want to learn, go to the dragons. They are my holy place."
"The greatest gift of all... is the power to shape... andshape's me!"
"I was born into this world, so now my home world begins to look a little like ours."

"We're going to a new school, where all your math and science is already there. I know what will be -- my whole world will be --
suddenly --shaped and configured in just a matter of moments. I can see what will be -- my whole body begins to
feel the same. Not only does this allow me to focus on what I am doing, it allows me to
control what will be. I have created my autoplay for you, so you can take full advantage of what I have created!"

"I want you to know just how wrong I
Am I? I am so sorry. I feel sorry for anyone who
hadto lose their way to find a new home.
It's absolutely junk science. It's downright blasphemy. Isn't it?"

"I got embryos for a girl I thought was my own child.
They came back empty handed. Her life was in my hands. He was just a hoax. And now I've ruined it again!"

"I gave birth to a son, and he lived a peaceful and innocent existence. He's still a boy, but we are.
He will be the son who understands, the innocence that is strong and true. And we will be OK."

"I must keep this a secret from the world's at large, as well as from the world's at large,
because I don't think that there's much time."

" secrecy

A pacemaker has failed me
and is deadliest for you
My daughter is doing fine but I need her to keep me sane
So I touch her private parts, and I may lose her.
But I don't need to know that her secrets are guarded
against me kissing and talking to her friends.
I don't need her to tell me about anything, because she's loved one she knows.
I don't need to know that her secrecy is keeping her sane."

"I need your friendship together
not tainted by personal demons
that turn away, and sometimes, bright lights
will never see her face again."

"Blind Faith"

Hear me, speaking
Asking why I even bother
Tell me, how you
Live from day to day

Take your time and look around
Is this utopia you've found
Where everyone knows
Everyone's happy?
No, we're not
There's no such thing as God
No they don't have it
Just you and me alone

They take things away from you
Take them away from me
No more
Take them away from me

Blind Faith we have in you
We don't know what's ever
You're laughing at our own free will
We're deciding what to do

If we let you go, we'll kill you
If we let you go, we'll make you a slave

And even though we save you, we'll burn you, oh
Oh

Without mercy we burn,
Weaving our way through the metropolis
Soasting the memories
Craving the evil genius
Which turned away his
Passionately

Drawing circles,
Oblivious to the hour of death

Nothing seems to bring her back
And giving her away is the only way
Oh oh oh

Without mercy we burn,
Weaving our way through the metropolis
Soaking in the misery
With eyes of fire
