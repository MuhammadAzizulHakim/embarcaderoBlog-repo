======================================== SAMPLE 50 ========================================
All things will be
Always waits for you
No one is new
All things will be
Always waits for you

Until one day a cruel godhead told him all
He told him no to faith and reason
He is the symbol of our times
and on that holy day
the world lost its faith
Now part of me wants you to know
There's something in the water
that lulls you down
And as you explore the underworld of
dream control
You'll find that the answers lie not far away

Until one day a sickly pink snake emerged from beneath the floor
Snaps of a long way down
It was the turning point
A decisive moment of fate

Blood...That Was All
Blood...Was All
Blood...Was All
Blood...Was All
Blood...Was All

"My Last Farewell"

I rose from my sleep
Deliverance struck me
Again

She walked into the night
She held her head up high in the name of harmony
She turned around to me
And said
"This life is too brief
It is too cold
You can have it all again
Just remember me?"

I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
And saw
Yes I could.

"How We Met"

I walked through the dark
With the coldness of a veil
I found that I was not alone
I had a part in the too-familiar end
I was the one who told me
All humankind has crossed
And all it takes
We all die
The devil and his still sisters
Deception and fall
So I made my way back home
It was too late for me
Only a spiritual mine
I traveled with the devil
As I walked through the city
It's too late to wonder

How we ended this life
So we think it ends
With our souls together
Or was it forever
?

"The Ones Who Help To Set The Sun"

Watching my window I was led like a wild child
With the dead in my path
I didn't know what I was seeing
But I know I's helping you
The loss of everything
Helps to set the sun
So before we head to the bed
Where we began
With our well-fed children
Feeding on the chaos
Before we can begin
The collective will of the minds
That gave us everything

Let us remember
That we are one body
One mind

Helpless in the morning with the world at war
Moment of helplessness
Sudden bust of heat
Getting worse as the minute went on
Heat exhaustion
A red sky burns before me
And in the evening when no one is around
I find it hard to hang

Helpless in the afternoon with the world at war
Moment of helplessness
Sudden bust of heat
Getting worse as the minute went on
Heat exhaustion
A red sky burns before me
And in the evening when no one is around
I find it hard to hang

"Ordinary Days"

I have a feeling that you will too
Look through my diary
Tell me what it seems
Nothing's changing
The day went by really fast
Now I can't wait to get there

I have a feeling that you will too
Look through my diary
Tell me what it seems
Nothing's changing
The day went by so suddenly
Now I can't wait to get there

"Prologue"

Silent scream for help
Fear disguised in calmness
Nothing is new
Nothing seems clear
And nowhere is trust my soul again

I can remember pain and it's still hurting me
I can't escape it
It hangs around the world waiting for somebody
It's raining...
I can't find the water
And I'm sinking deeper

Nothing seems right
I'm on my own
I try to numb it
But it's almost over now
I'm on my own
Not connected
I try to keep moving
But it's almost over now
I'm on my own

"Sever"

Whatever comes to mind
It can't be right
Whatever comes to mind
It will always sadden the soul
Until it's too late
Sometimes the saddest thing that ever happened

I never learned how to be happy
I never learn how to be happy
I never learn how to be happy

I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
