======================================== SAMPLE 27 ========================================
You can never know what lies ahead

I woke up.
I learned what I longed for
But now mortality haunts me
I lock myself away
And no-one will see me this time

"That I Can't Tell You What You're Made Of"

I was born in '67. And spent all my time thinking about my career.
I was looking forward to a new adventure when, in the blink of an eye, I saw a red light surrounded by darkness.
Two young men standing by the window. Whispering words that should have been laughed aloud.
'"Let's go fetching..."
It was me, it was her.
I followed them behind the window
They were alone, trying to find the light.
The echo of a voice that had come to be.
She could have sworn that I'd heard it all before.

Blood-red eyes, red lips, cold hands reaching for the light.
In that moment, I believed that I'd found the truth.
At that moment, both of my life decisions had been right.
At that moment, my life's hell had come to an end.

I woke up.
Made a good impression, I should've won.
I walked away.
Surrounded in all the darkness.
I still remember the piercing cries that once rang through my chest.
Those memories are still vivid, flickering on and on and on.
These are the memories that once kept me sane and sane.
These are the memories of a dream that I had just once inside my bedroom.
It lasted for a good while.
It told me everything that I thought about and did not take into account.
It made me want to kill myself.
This is my revenge for killing my best friend.

I have tried to call for assistance, but all I receive is a slow and steady drip.
Several hours have expired, and I cannot meet the appointment.
I please contact the store and let me know that my appointment is close.

I need to know that someone save me and save my mind,
Someone save me and save my mind

"That I can't tell you what you're made of is a lie, areckoning, achingly prideful narcissist.
I've come to my senses, I must visit the ghost of my former self.
There's something in the way that I live my life, somehow I find April's ghost seem to recognize me.
And I'm gonna break out this way...
This way...
This way...

Oh, yeah, and the PR man...
Well, he was kind enough with the facts...
Notable incidents in your memory...
I was involved with one myself.
One of which was kinda cool.
I forgot to mention that I love her.
And, yeah, I kinda like her...
