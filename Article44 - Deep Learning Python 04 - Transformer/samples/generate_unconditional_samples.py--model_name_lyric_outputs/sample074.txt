======================================== SAMPLE 74 ========================================
Music is a brother, to say nothing of reverence
Take it in all your extreme!

Our Father is a monster, he'll eat your soul
But we're the same religion, we're the same religion

Blood...Heated meats...Pastries folded in half
An eternal flame in your holy shrine
Where the wicked die...They're entrapped
And the noise from the thralls...It kills me

"I Pull The Voices"

Pull the Voices!
I pull the stories from the air
And turn them into dreams
Of feeling alive, of feeling alive again

Seasons change and so can I
Pull the voices!
from the air
And talk to you about your secret holy quest
Now I feel the same

As the children chatter on the pavements
And streets are paved with shadows
And shadows I see
The faces of the departed in my dream
Change every fortnight or so
By feeling alive again

Seasons change and so can I
Pull the voices!
from the air
And talk to you about your secret holy quest
Now I feel the same

"Halo"

I can't see the truth behind this
Hearing the cries of the rebels
A leader of an innocent people
Killing the flock for all its faith

Giving back control over your life
In death do you trust in this voice
Faith in the voice of our fellow man

Does this voice of revolution
Guilt and shame beat the conscience of the man

He was an admirer of our own prophet
He gave away his soul to save his soul
He called on his brothers and came to our aid

It was the voice of revolution
That brought us together
We spoke on the road to revolution

Our common destiny
Was set free
By the action of our fellow man

Brother gave his soul to save his soul
Brother was forever scarred
By division and enemy after enemy came to our aid

"Futile"

Someone died for looking too far
While I was asleep in my own self-indulgent way

There's a story in your eyes
There comes a time when the river separates us
And there comes a time when the blood keeps running
When I'm drowning because I don't want to start again

Someone died for what I wanted
Another drowned to make me feel better

<|endoftext|>

"Futile"

You were always my own man
You were always helping me find my voice
I always needed your sympathy
It's why I fight to end this pain

I can't live my life this way
There's no choice but to confront
The demons inside

There's a certain peace I've found
As I head into the night
I realize that I never lived the life I pretend

I'm a burden to be embraced
I'm forced to think outside the box
I'm shunned and ignored
I'm considered a failure

I'm a burden to be embraced
I'm forced to think outside the box
I'm shunned and ignored

There's too much pride in me
It's spitting on the ground
And I'm falling to fight for my place

I'm too blind to see
And all the things that concern me
Could having more time
Have left my mind behind
Have I gone astray

I'm too blind to see
And all the things that concern me
Could having more time
Have left my mind behind
It's not too late for me now
I can't live my life this way
I'm too blind to see
And all the things that concern me
Could having more time
Have left my mind behind

"Undertow"

One tiny detail that I will never forget
If I ever see

The note on the wall behind me
Seems to have been written by a stranger
Maybe it's something from a dream
Or a nightmare
Or just some other time

I'm not saying anything neath my bed
I'm just tired of doing what I'm used to
Sleep my life away

Like a bullet passed through the cage behind me
The hood of my car
Leaves me motionless
The pieces that I have falling down
Start my head on a new road

I may never get over
But I will build a new world from the ground up
If I press my luck

I'll build a new world from the ground up
If I press my right

"Undertow"

Two tiny things
Colliding with the truth that is mine
