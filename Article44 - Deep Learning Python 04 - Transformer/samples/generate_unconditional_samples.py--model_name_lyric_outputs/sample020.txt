======================================== SAMPLE 20 ========================================
But make no mistake, this is the kind of game we're
Playing 'em, this is the kind of
Playing'em who
Want to be a part of something
That kind of attitude
Will only get you to sleep
Speaking with eyes
That don't open
And following your dreams
This is where you lie
Alive from what might have been hours

I'm watching TV
And in the morning when I find I've forgotten how to write
I throw a window open wide and step through

Outside is where I'd fall
We walked the streets together
We wandered the streets with him
The two of us
Now it's time for the real deal
To end the suspense
So we can end this game for the worse

"Endless Sacrifice"

Passion
Heart
Voice
Dream
Wisdom
Ashes down
The floor

Ripped from my hands
Endless sacrifice
A reality TV show about me and me and me and me and me
It ends like a chapter of my life

Awaken the master
Awaken the master

And I will end this misery
This jealousy and envy
This hatred and resentment
Isn't it time we stopped the show?

And I will end this misery
This jealousy and envy
Isn't it time we stopped the series?

"Disappear"

We made the world believe we didn't care
We gate crashed everything
And we walked away
Feeling like we never left

Turned our backs on
Disappeared
We stayed the course
And wound up with all the answers
The proof shows that we spent the years
Always moving on
Moving on to somewhere else

Missing the point of the journey
Left us behind
Like all of you
We passed through a phase
One of confusion, then one of sadness
When we came up empty handed
The saddest thing that I have ever heard
Is still sung by my soul provoked

I'm moving closer to my death
While all the years are lost

And all this time
I'm painting a dream for her
That she would stay
And cry,
As I move closer to my death

She was the one, the one, the one
I fell for
The sheer strangeness
A yearning that she would embrace

And now I can't pass the gas
While all that's left are rumors and innuendos
I'll never trust her
I'm reaching for the moon
While all this death has left are undone

Move your head,
Frown out your eyelids
And put your faith in a wall

You believed me,
bore into the crowd
You believed me and I was the one
who would lead you to believe

In the embers of autumn
All things must die
There's a passage of fire ahead
Fire in the trees
Fire in the stream

Our bodies met in the pouring rain
A body could not be saved
If faith were a concern
There was a need in the first place

God and country,
This is God and country
God and country
God and country

"Disappear"

Aligning amnesia
In the stream of youth
Behind the palace walls

One great silence
As the story unfolds
Waits for me to find
The source of her strength

standing above the crowd
One great uncertainty
As I look down

Standing above the crowd
One great uncertainty
As I look down

I cannot remember how
Under these eyes
All my dreams are a blur
Trying to remember what all my
happened to
Before the events in my life

Signals in the mist
Falling through pages of Shakespeare's tragedy
A sorrow celebration

Suddenly I'm sick and tired of feeling invisible
Feeling like I've never seen or heard of
Ascending ever higher
In search of the uninvited man
Those eyes...

Taunting me with his absence
A silent prayer urging him to make his way

Still I wait for the moment
Invincible man
Counting miles on my hands

As I read between the lines
The length of his insane runs
Is cutting through the night

Like a bullet from a dream
Spinning through my head

Still I wait for the moment
Invincible man
Counting miles on my hands

And as I'm sent shivering
I'm finding my strength in the blink of an eye

<|endoftext|>

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I surrender to his cries
And I welcome his spite
I am too perfect
To see
