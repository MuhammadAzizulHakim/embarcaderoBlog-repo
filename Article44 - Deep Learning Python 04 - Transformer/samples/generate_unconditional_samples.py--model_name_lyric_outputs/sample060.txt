sparrow,

All you scared me of,
Was it all lost?

The fact that you and I
Can't Get Away,
Even if We Can,
Saving Face,
Hope Leaves

"In The Presence Of Enemies, Pt. 1"

[I Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[II Resurrection]

I saw a white light
Shining there before me
And walking to it
I waited for the end
A final vision
Promising salvation
A resurrection
For a fallen man

Do you still wait for your God
And the symbol of your faith?
I can reveal this challenge
With confidence and determination

I can show you how
How I can lead you to believe
In the face of hardships
And show you how
How I can help you break right through this Hell and back again
Again

"Cusp Of Eternity"

A child of autumn was born
In an instant a change of pace
Faced with uncertainty and death at hand
Forever she dreamed of this moment

So fragile
She couldn't hold on
She had to pull herself together
She prayed for help
But in the end none came
She would leave behind

And so she waited
But no relief came
Not spreading far
She had to break down doors
And take their money
She had to fly

She wanted so much more
She thought she knew
Of the reason why
The night was stronger
She thought she knew
A friend of hers
Was with her

"Repentance"

[VIII Regret]
Hello, mirror, so glad to see you my friend
It's been a while...

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage running through my head
Patterns of my life I thought adorned me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament

Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life
that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And sometimes you've got to be strong
When the end is near

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking about the dreaded task in store for me
A pit of fear at the thought of my amends

Hoping that this step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this unswept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

[IX Restitution]

"â€¦just in case"
I heard her voice I knew she was a supporter
Kicking the can down the gate
Holding up the cause
While wishing the one thing she loves so dearly
Baying for the cause
She's never felt so lost and alone
I'm looking for a way to help her feel more heard
She's a Witch waiting pit for her
Soul more powerful than life

"Heaven's Cove"

[VI Salvation]

I stuck by my ways
Took control of my heart
And poured out the first brick
Building my way out
Winding ever higher

I got to know the man
The man who changed me
Turning all that was right with
