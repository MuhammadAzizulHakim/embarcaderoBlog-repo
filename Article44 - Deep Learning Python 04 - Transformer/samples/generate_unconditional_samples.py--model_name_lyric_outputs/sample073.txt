======================================== SAMPLE 73 ========================================
By the way, our chapel was full of angels
And some kind of power struggle
Over what view to take
And how to lay a stick
Righteous conflict...

"Scene Nine: Finally Free"

[Hypnotist:]
You are once again surrounded by the cosmos
Cosmic dust and fire
Everything beyond a shadow of a doubt

From the swift destruction experienced in terms of hours of breath
To the spreading fire seen in shades of silver,
A thousand dreams in amount

From the ecstasy of sleeping
To the birth of a follower
To the final judgement made by heart

From a seed in a fire
To a new beginning
To a developing friendship
X two years

And as I reach for the rhyme book
I find I have left my home

The cosmos is a part of me
I am no longer a human
And all my questions are just guesses
While inside the mind
I am diving
The mind starts running

'Cause the scene from my vantage point
Is so clear and evident
No nerves tearing me apart

Into the universe
A consciousness fading
With a light touch
A consciousness red
Feeling alive
Feelings deepen
As if the story is real

And all this time
It's all because I suck it up
And down inside

Nothing seems to penetrate me
All I see is blank slate
And then a dream comes into
And I can't remember what's happened

Closer to home
The closeness never ending
As I'm seen from miles away

I'm so new I seem to have lost myself
And can't seem to remember what's happened

Self doubt crippling me
I'm turning away for good
Can't find the strength to live life
Another loss at the hands of my love

Still I crave your impulsive ways
And I understand that we can't always know each other
So I'm reaching for the rhyme book

For 30 years
I've witnessed black magic go astray
Many a time I've been struck dumb
I remember I was pulled over for speeding
For failing a breath test
I remember I was refused a breath test
But it turned out I was legal in my own home state

"Scene Ten: Finally Free"

[Hypnotist:]
You are once again surrounded by the cosmos
Part of me is still alive
Part of me has passed beyond this moment
To reach out and embrace the whole universe

Once again we dance in the moonlight
Eleven becoming one again

[Dance]
Eleven became one when she was finally free
Eleven became one when she was rejected

[Dance]

Your body is my symbol
My body is mine to follow
My body with you is mine to sell
My body with you is mine to possess

My feet are your guide
My head is your ammunition
My heart is your gold
My heart with you is mine for iron
My heart with you is mine for his brains

My lips are your clues
My tongue is your code
My heart is your salvation
My heart with you is yours to blame
My heart with you is yours to heal

My knife is your fatal weakness
My knife is your weapon
My knife is yours to take

My bow is your way of assuring everyone
That I'm okay
That I'm through with this charade...

[Runs off]

Through all the obstacles that I've found
Through the fire of my faith
Sobbing with me...

[Sits down]
Finally free again
Open mind and ears
Letting go of all my fears

Self belief will never save you
You're going down alone
Eternally
With you and the one that never left you

[Turns on]
All your fears into reason
And your head with you after all you've died

[Finds its way]

After all the time you've had
Before you've had
One breath within the one she holds
You reason with me
Keep the flame burning
Unyielding

Until we meet again
III.
Gather ye ye ye labourers
And help me where I can
To build a world for you
One that is eternal, for you are just a piece of me
Gather ye ye ye labourers
And help me when I can,
To build a world for you
One that is eternal, for you are just a piece of me

Gather ye ye ye labourers
And help me when I can,
To build a world for you
One that is eternal, for you are just a piece of me
