Always the fear within
besieged of his sins
immune and thralls of pain

Black procession through the narrow aisles
A violent andatheist's dream
Struggling to bring us more light
and humanity

Blinding light as the ever-moving lens
Controlling my thoughts and dreams

Predictable and dangerous
Often the worst misdeeds Forexorthand

"Invincible"

Long in tooth and soul
Longing for another win
Lurch into the fray
Weapon out and belly in

Warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Baring all that he's been
Withering ways with his skin
And feasting feasting on my pride

Bellow aloud
Baring all that he's been
Withering ways with his skin
And feasting
On my weakness
And gaining ground

"Heart in Hand"

"To Rise, To Fall"
The Watt Down The Van
Set The Sun Back Down
Set The Moon Back Down
Let It Rain
And Fuck Thy Mommies Before They Lay

I'm getting older
I'm more surefooted
And I'm wired the way I'm wired
I still feel that way
I still feel that way

I can't seem to take
The roads give conflicting signs
There's a void in the air
And all I can do is wait

Save your soul Catalonia
And go back to your home

"Last Chance To Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycled"

[a) Winding Shot (Summer 1981)]

If you fall asleep with me
You can dream and drowse
The miuntes turn to hours

We could climb a tree or two
And watch the sun go down
Upon our sleepy town

After all the time I spent with you
Summer went away
And we just weren't the same

It's just you and me alone
Not grown ups but not kids
We folded ourselves into a ball
And watched the sun go down
Upon our sleepy town

[b) Kung Fu Panda (Summer 1981)]

You're gonna want that pose again
If you want to get a better look
You can even buy a new T-shirt
You can even buy a new light machine
And when we fall down together
We can laugh for a second

And smile together
You can tell me you love
And we can tell him you wanna stay
You can tell me you don't wanna be apart
You can tell me you're gonna love me again

And if you fall asleep with me
You can dream and drowse
The miuntes turn to hours

We could climb a tree or two
And watch the sun go down
Upon our sleepy town

"Fear Inoculum"

Sunlight coming through the haze
A father's benediction
As his son slips into a
Slave Called Lassie

Adoring new sonic wealth
Regular people are passing by
Seen in the news once a week

He has a newsstand nearby
He's got his hands bound
He's got his newsstand nearby
He's got his news...

Without the aid of magic
Without the same assistance
I wouldn't know where I'd be without you
Without the unconditional love
That burns in me
Nothing would stand in my way

Without the unconditional love
That burns in me
Nothing would stand in my way

Without the unconditional love
That burns in me
Nothing would stand in my way

Without the unconditional love
That burns in me
Nothing would stand in my way

Without the unconditional love
That burns in me
Nothing would stand in my way

"S6ES"

Black Sunday of sleep
By the way, it's me
I'm so afraid to be alive
When my mother and father
Received the news
A boy has gone missing
Sometime in the future they'll send for a Narcotic

Sleeping with fear
By the window of night
While I'm wrapped up in bed
I feel so hopeless and
