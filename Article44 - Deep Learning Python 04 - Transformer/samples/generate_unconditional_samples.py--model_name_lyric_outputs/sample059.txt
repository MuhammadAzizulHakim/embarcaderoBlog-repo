======================================== SAMPLE 59 ========================================
Moon exploded, killing all

Someday tomorrow

I will be gone

Until a lamentable night
Where empty words and senseless acts
Concede
To the splendour of night

Whispered cries
Assenting to the dark

Disturbing images
Of the creature from the heart
Slurred voice, pestered
His secret sufferings uncovered

His thoughts are proceding
Zenspection, drawing the line
And there is nothing I can do

I am not broken
Nor am I broken
Won't be
Tore up from the wreckage
And throw to the wind

As the night went on
I started to find my peace of mind
I learned about a tragedy

Lying in my bed
At ease without a dream
Nothing but death in store

Once again my mind
Lost control and stifled me
The sounds froze my thoughts
Suddenly I'm caught in a stutter

I want to flush the slate clean
I try to relax
And at last the written word
Is revealed
As my will alone is enough for me

And so I wiped the dust somewhere
And resumed my solitary life
I am so alone

In a river of tears
I wish I could remember everything
But never could
It was you
That I chose to be with you
And now that you're gone

"Scarred"

To prosper
To fall
To anyone
For lust in yourself

To keep my peace of mind

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their saviour's calling
Of yours

On a deserted moon
In the pouring rain
Who could deny
The emotion that burns within
As I witness the destruction of my country?

I cannot see the truth
But I can forgive you
If you will not forgive me

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their savior's calling
Of yours

To know the one who's leaving
To see the day when all of their fears are gone

Someone new beginning
New beginning
You are the one
With the one who never left

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their savior's calling
Of yours

"Blackwater Park"

Confessor
Of the tragedies in man
Lurking in the core of us all
The Last Exodus

The last humans
Were wiped out by the the living
I am the one who will always remember
Those moments
When the angel of the lord
Poured forth his wrath, scorching through the crowd
It was the last for me

The crowd cried out for Gabriel
Lured into a corner
As his soul was torn apart
It was the last for me

I remember the moment
When I heard the angel of the lord
Poured forth his wrath, scorching through the crowd
It was the last for me

The anger in me
Still burning bright
Still seeking to be calmed
I would cast away the fear that was burning inside
I would lead the way for my savior
Someone new beginning
New beginning

To know and understand the true meaning of this terrible episode
It has been made
I have sworn to follow your example no matter how far
Lead me through every step
Be my own man

When I hear the angel of the lord
Pours forth his wrath, scorching through the crowd
It is the last for me

[I Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[II Resurrection]

I saw a white light
Shining there before me
And walking to it
I waited for the end
A final vision
Promising salvation
A resurrection
For a fallen man
Or a barren waste of water

My soul was drained from the world
My eyes lost its glow
I was lost in the cold

A resurrection
For a fallen man
Or a barren waste of water
My soul was drained from the world
My eyes lost its glow

Restless ghost of a death
Ilett d'Orleans
captured within a final thought
Into a silent sleep
I felt the shadow cast on the ground
As I passed through the stages of my fall

Nothing ever wanting me
Still seeking redemption
Always kept a dark secret from the start
A hopeless maze in which I placed all my bets
And hidden all my wealth behind a mask of guarded secrets

I was drained of all desire
Still constantly on the run
From violent dreams to bliss
From a life of misery to bliss
From a life of misery to bliss
From a life of
