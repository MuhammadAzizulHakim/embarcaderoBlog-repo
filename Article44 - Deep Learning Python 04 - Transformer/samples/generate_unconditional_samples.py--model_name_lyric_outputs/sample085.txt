======================================== SAMPLE 85 ========================================
In honor of those few years
When the mice die young
The rats will advance
They will never know
And the lost souls we meet
Are never-ending

"Black Dahlia"

Lone hunter in western ways
With soft, leather vestments
Where do we draw the line?

When she talks about ending it all
White coat heard about
Black Dahlia
The mother of all cowards
And the ones who could not forgive

Sick of the strife
Of the light
Of the day
While day are still bright

She holds her children
And tells them of his woe

When she talks about ending it all
White coat bestowed
On those she does not see

When she talks about endangering lives
And the ways of her children
She is talking about all that she has always done
Wondering when she will once again

Wondering when she will again

Sick of the strife
Of the light
Of the day
While day are always bright

She holds her children
And tells them of her wicked ways

And how her love burns in her eyes
Black Dahlia
The mother of all cowards
And the ones who could not forgive

Sick of the strife
Of the light
Of the day
While day are always bright

"Sorceress 2"

In a lonely corner of your soul
There waits a ghost
That waits for you in the darkness
One who could destroy your life or at least damage your soul
Shaman take your hand and lead you
Outside the forms of doubt you fashion

[Solo: Åkerfeldt, Åkesson]

Brace yourself now
Be still till we can remember
What you have always done
And what you wish you have always done

[Solo: Åkesson, Åkerfeldt]

And what is left without you?
Whatever it takes
Whatever it takesobe you
You are not without
And when you feel you have left everything behind
you are forgiven on account of me

And what is left without you?
Whatever it takes
Whatever it takesobia you has received
A place in heaven
and a place in hell

And what is left without you?
Whatever it takes
Whatever it takesobia you has received

"Sorceress"

Nothing is stronger than faith
In the face of doubt
From love's beginning
Nothing is new
Just accepting the truth
Of who we are

In a garden where the seeds were sown
The seed is stored up
In the wake of our own futile deeds

Nothing is new
Just accepting the truth
Of who we are

We forge our own destinies
We look the other way
We're not afraid of facing facts
They are our senses
We're wired up to a fever

As we sit here drinking from the same gin
We're rejecting the new
Because everything is new
It's not the first time
It's not the last
But there was a point in time
When we both knew
That what we believe in is what matters

Nothing is new
Just accepting the truth
Of who we are

"The Answer"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Ramblings:]
The scratching of a mellotron
It always burns my soul...

The scratching of a mellotron
It always burns my soul...

Sifting through the wreckage of aPurse
Before me lies a sorrow boundless sight
Embracing our common ground

tonning hand forged a Dirge for you today
tonning love forged a Johto sun

Forge a new Sun
With or without you
In the silence of our dew
Your light would give birth to aSearching
Unwinding our lifelong ties

Once set ablaze
Now silhouetted in goldenCorps, glow of autumn's summers

I turn
