[Touch-tone entry]

The ignition switch is held aloft by a sterling blackened coat.
The ignition brings the sun into this smog-filled courtyard.
Underneath these walls I see proof of a past obsession.
Her dream comes alive, absorbs me,
Like the angel in the sun,
She sacrifices herself for me.

The scratching of a mellotron
By mice and woogs is done.
They hang and fret,
And photograph me,
Like ancient times when speaking of
What have I done?

Now they know,
I'm the same people who thought
Deus Ex provocative?

They huddle around me,
Department of Satan,
Reading eye,
One wonders what they'll think
Of my mission?

I'm the one who will stand up
And guide you down.
As you're facing the path
Which limits one's freedom,
I'm the one who will speak
And lead you there.

As I'm reaching for the end,
I'm holding back,
I'm not sure where to start,
I need direction.

Tunnel vision,
The answer lies right in my eyes.

Why can't we not be sober?
The answer lies inside my gaze.
The eyelids of my eyes have moved
And I'm staring down.
There's no turning back.

I need to find a new home.
I need to find the innocence that I don't yet know

"Never Enough"

I know some of you are crying
And want to comfort us
But we must keep our peace of mind

For any hour
Any day
Everything will change

Daily life
Can't continue on as it should
And living on regrets
Will never enough make us forget this man

Ignorant and blind
We're staring at pictures
But the truth is clear

We live in a sea of circumstance
And without hard feelings
We're without a clue

Not questioning faith
Being asked what motivates
This attitude that sometimes blinds me

Sometimes I feel like I'm living up
I'm 28
Yet so longed to be
A voice inside your head
Sits you down.

Sometimes I feel like I'm living up
I'm 28
Yet so longed to be
A voice inside your head
Sits you down.


As we sit here drinking from the Etonian stream
You know the kind of person I am
And you're going to know the kind of man I am

We're sitting here drinking from the river
But the truth is clear
We live in a world of circumstance
And without hard feelings
We're without a clue

Being asked what motivates
This attitude that sometimes blinds me

Sometimes I feel like I'm living up
I'm 28
Yet so longed to be
A voice inside your head
Sits you down.

"The Count Of Tuscany"

Several years ago
In a foreign town
Far away from home
I met the Count of Tuscany

A young eccentric man
Bred from royal blood
Took me for a ride
Across the open countryside

Get into my car
Let's go for a drive
Along the way
I'll be your guide
Just step inside

Maybe you recall
A cannibal curator
A character inspired by my brother's life

Winding through the hills
The city far behind
On and on we drove
Down narrow streets and dusty roads

Nothing seems to excite me
Though I'm intrigued
By his eccentric coxpered wife

Counting hours lost
While driving on the moon
The surreal beauty is evident

In the kitchen we made our own wine
On the stone glazed temple

Maybe you recall
A cannibal curator
A character inspired by my brother's life

Watching my brother get lost
In the distant lights of the sun
The detail is masterful

Nothing seems to scare me
Might be a precursor to his eventual disappearance

Like a stone dagger
Slaying planet X
in a flurry of light

Moving through a city road less traveled
Sleeping with friends on the moon
A tedious and endless game
With or without you

Traveling through paleness
With less than with you

Ariel's mask slipping face
Asking me where I've been
Asking me what I've been up to
Given me
