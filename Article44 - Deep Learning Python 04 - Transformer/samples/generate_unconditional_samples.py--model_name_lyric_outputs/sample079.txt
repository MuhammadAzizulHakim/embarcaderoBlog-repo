"Love Song"

I was playing rock and roll and one of the musicians came to me
He said, "We don't have a whole lot of time
We want to know what you think
What songwriting should be.
Forget your ego and listen to this song
It's about love and music.
 It's not even about faith.
It's not even about death.
It's only about us, us alone.

So listen to this song
It's all about life, love and music

Nothing is sacred
And love songs are just that
About Life

If I die tomorrow I am gone wrong
And all those years
Are gone on me and them

Nothing is sacred
And love songs are just that
About Love And Music

Love song
Love song
Love song
Love song
Love song

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all you barely able to see
You are the junkie we know and love
We are the ones on the roof
Wash your hands of the past
Clean up your soul
For us the fence is uninvaded

And help yourself
To all you barely able to see
You are the junkie we know and love
We are the ones on the roof
Wash your hands of the past
Clean up your soul
For us the fence is uninvaded

And help yourself
To all you barely able to see
You are the junkie we know and love
We are the ones on the roof
Wash your hands of the past
Clean up your soul
For us the fence is uninvaded

Tear down the wall break
Endless guilt for the day when we found you
When we found you you were mine

"Lipan Conjuring"

Lepid side effects
After all they've lost you
Skin is red and swollen
and wish there was no more

Lipan conjuring
can't stop the world from turning around
You can feel the change starting to wash over you
Lipan conjuring
can't stop the world from turning around

Lipan conjuration
can't stop the world from turning around

Lipan conjuration
can't stop the world from turning around

"Under The Weeping Moon"

The moon moves in a circle
Like a ghost
It always burns
In the past midnight
When we lay down
With the moon in our hands
We have an inner peace
And in the new moonlight
We never felt so lonely

The moon moves in a circle
Like a ghost
It always burns
In the past midnight
When we lay down
With the moon in our hands
We have an inner peace
And in the new moonlight
We never felt so lonely

The moon moves in a circle
Like a ghost
It always burns
In the past midnight
When we lay down
With the moon in our hands
We have an inner peace
And in the new moonlight
We never felt so lonely

"Under The Weeping Moon"

How long can a child
Hold within a shadow of death?

One moonlight blinded sight
I saw the burning cross
It was the weight of my life

The moon moves in a circle
Like a ghost
It always burns
In the past midnight
When we lay down
With the moon in our hands
We have an inner peace
And in the new moonlight
We never felt so lonely

"Black Dahlia"

You have brought fear into our lives
Over the past year or so
And you have been subject to endless nightmares
You speak of the "great silence"
"that waits beneath the white walls of your mind
Crushing your self doubt

But it's not enough for you
You must try and think twice before you give in

You must test your mettle
And test your mettle again
Before you know it
You will have won your mind's first war

No one is innocent
And no one is righteous
If all you have done is guess
You will be defenseless
Your guilt will never leave your body
Trial by combat, over the years
You determined what is right
And what is wrong

No matter how hard you try
You will never be a par to the nines

You bring the world to me
When I'm down you'll be standing by

You have brought fear into our lives
And you have been subjecting us
To endless nightmares
You speak of the
