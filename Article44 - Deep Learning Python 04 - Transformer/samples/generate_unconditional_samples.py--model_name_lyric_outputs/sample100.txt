======================================== SAMPLE 100 ========================================
The premonition's true wake
Wake up
Acting all surprised
Finding ourselves kindred spirits

Kneel before the strangers
Standing before the sunrise
Those seeking the answers
Since the gods take their toll

Knowingly observing order
The crowd applauds
The prophet in his temple
All praise his temple
A place without a god
They pay their respects
To the sun, the moon, the wind
And the warrior
Standing up for what's lesser
There's a stone standing stones
For lesser are born
Those born of the ashes in the sea

Soul anger rising
Brings us all to tears
Destroying what's left
Soul escaping
Waging a war inside
It's all the same
But the prophet
Truth be told, I wasn't told the truth
Until it's so publicly reported
That I was a martyr for revolution
That I was crucified for my sins

I feel the scars
I know the answers
Know the truth
Until my final rays shine
Burn the pride that binds me

[Solo: Ã…kerfeldt]

Reaction from all around
The faithful newfound faith
In sympathy I could not find anyone
But baffled rage lashed down
Igniting in the skies
My soul received wisdom wielding blows she would never take
The angel of balance brought me into this blinding light

Angels above, I saw they would not be standing still
As their scorn turned to joy

Men of faith and honor, I knew they would not bowl
Yet they always seem to be ignored
Just because the prophets promised
 Amendment for liberty
And blind faith, I saw it couldn't be denied

She had died long ago
She is still venerated
A belief found strength in her spirit
Yet pride is an opinion
Yet she holds her ground

Angels above, I saw they would not be standing still
As their scorn turned to joy
These days they are holding their breath and waiting
Though apprehension reigns, agitation hides
Finally it's time for the dark
To come to an end

Angels above, I saw they would not be standing still
As their scorn turned to joy

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their salvation
Ravenskill brews in the air
Like the devil in wine
But without God
As the sovereign
Of eternal sighs and sighs

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their salvation
Spurring the ravenskill to explore new worlds
Lured into darkness

"Along For The Ride"

[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Collapse The Light Into Earth".]
"Oh, we'll know in a moment
When we hear the undertow will end
We know that the closer we get to the truth
The closer we get to the truth
The closer we get to the truth

Oooooh oooh
Oooooh
Oh, we'll know in a moment
When we dare to tread
No more The Answer will they or they won't hear

We know that the foothills of mountain bliss
Will lie beyond our dreams
And yet the night is still the wrong time
Angels above, I saw they would not hear us
For they who can see with certainty
The plight of the little girl we barely know

We know that the foothills of mountain bliss
Will lie beyond our dreams
And yet the night is still the wrong time
Angels above, I saw they would not hear us
For they who can see with certainty
The plight of the little girl we barely know

We always dream of you
We always wish you away
But never will know she's been missing you

"Lines In The Sand"

Sometimes, for a moment of bliss
And the pain is real
Just waiting for the otherness
To disappear

Crawling through darkest caverns of my heart
To find the river again

Into the darkness
Lies a tyrant
And a liar

Like a blind man in a maze
Who can never know what they're really thinking
Eager to push the boundaries

Sometimes, for a moment of bliss
And the pain is real
Just waiting for
