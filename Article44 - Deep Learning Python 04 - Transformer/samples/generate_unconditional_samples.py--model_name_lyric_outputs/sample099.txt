======================================== SAMPLE 99 ========================================
The place I grew up on
Where I dwell now they'll be finding
Like seeds of trouble
The culling of the herd

Remember when I lived inside
Like a burden of water still over my shoulder?

I've sailed through but cannot reached land
Where I can lay a hand up
My head is paralyzed
And the ocean of sorrow is burning
As my heart is pounding
Another vessel lost

Lying in this barren wasteland
Where rats and flies
Bathing in dead flesh
As death becomes a jaded quest

Lying in this barren wasteland
Where rats and flies
Bathing in dead flesh
As my heart is pounding
And the ocean of sorrow is burning
As my heart is pounding
Another vessel lost

"The Patient"

A groan of tedium escapes me,
Startling the fearful
Desperate to claw its way back home

And as I'm falling again
I'm lying in wait
This morbid fascination escapes me,
Startling the fearful
Desperate to claw its way back home

And I can't escape this feeling,
I'm lying in wait
No amount of sleepless nights can prepare me
For the worst, most brutal way to death.

I am immortal,
Not here,
I must hide behind a wall of fear
To survive
It is all caught up with me now

"No Quarter"

Under NIGHT
Under AFI

Losing all sense of yearning
Living in the dark

Dripping with worry
Nothing seems to carry on
ODDS TO THE RESTORATION

Failure has taken all we can take
It's only when the raging storm subside
That we can turn our backs on the maddest of selfish hypocrites.

"Precious Life"

A single shattered candle stands in the corner
Where proud fathers pray
Every Sunday morning
The lamplights are out the window
Where eccentric brothers smoke

I was always your shadow
A fluttering shadow castting the lone light
ature disco ballerinas

My silhouette as black as dirt
And my skin as blue as snow

A single shattered candle stands in the corner
Where proud fathers pray
Every Sunday morning
The lamplights are out the window
Where eccentric brothers smoke

"Godhead's Lament"

I dealt with Satan before
I was God,
And I'm still free here
In the light from which I flow,

Waiting for an end to this endless torture
That I may reward you with more glory
By coming up with new ways of doing
That I despise you all for
One moment of boredom
And you're glowing too
I'm your laughing stock
Long gone are the days

Once I awaited the dawn
With tenderness you're my tender embrace

I'm waiting for an end to this endless misery
That I may reward you with more glory
By coming up with new ways of doing
That I despise you all for
One moment of boredom
And you're smoking your cigar
I'm giving you a smoke
While the martyrs of your faith
Follow your dreams
Are fading away

Waiting for an end to this endless misery
That I may reward you with more glory
By coming up with new ways of doing
That I despise you all for
One moment of boredom
And you're smoking your cigar
I'm giving you a smoke

"One Last Time"

[CNN report:]
"The sound of a sound was heard in the distance...and I could not help but feel that it was a new sound. The feeling was quite sudden, as if driven by some kind of spiritual experience. Someone had died many years ago, and I could not help but feel that loss must linger inside me. I was drifting, and the feeling was quite sudden."

"A voice rang out from the void below me, saying...that all souls bound by the oath I took was now back together. A sorrow celebration was held across the whole earth, with a wealth of rewards."

"The moon turned away its face and smiled thoughtfully at me, passing the bag with a halo."

"As I reached for the promised land
I could not resist the scarlet lettering on her face. She spoke of the years of sorrow, as though she had never seen it."

"I am alone now, and I do not know where to start, but soon I will know what I am seeking: freedom, truth and life. Together we could build a world that is true
and bright and strong, where love and death are inseparable..."
