God is upon us
And our prey is upon us

"Venomous Offer"

Harper's edition, p. 301

"...the devil's tongue is withered
They speak of beauty and manmade disasters
Others are conceded disasters
Withering my eye contact,
Whispering "you've got to"
When in doubt
包吝(cold blood)

"Beating Heart with a Devil"

In the corner beside my window
Is where her heart lies
I feel the heat
A fire is burning
A wound is bleeding
A regret is spreading
A wound is growing
Genghis Knew how
How could I know
How he should know

Fighting is death
But fighting is God's way
God is on our side
God is martyr
God is free

Fighting is death
But fighting is God's way
God is on our side
God is on our side
God is on our side
God is on our side
God is on our side
God is on our side

"The Enemy Inside"

Over a cup of tea
The tea leaves fall
As the night draws near

Too much freedom thrown away
And no amount of good times
Will shake this tired distrust

Under a knife's edge I find
The enemy inside

Preying on faith
and secrecy
on youthful unrest
is the path that we have chosen

Silence is another way
Of oblivion
Might be a better way

Third thoughts are hypocrites
analyzing his thoughts

With a saw and chain
I receive the good news
With closed eyes I am convinced
Of everlasting life

Blood is thicker, less guilt
A journey to find the river back again

Than ever looking back
As the leaves fall leaves thinner
And the night becomes a day

Spring is thinner, sweat is thicker
Better to fall inside
And shine with my eyes

In the morning when I find I have lost you
I lift you up again
And share in the ride back

"The Driving Force"

There is a void surrounding me
Out of which come the weak and the sluggish
Strong are born the weak

There is a place where I lost you
There is a way that saved me
That is, a way that he knew
A way that I could live up to my calling
If only for a second

Before the leaves fell
Before the leaves faded white
Here wherewith to hide
My shadow was born
As I was reaching for the light
I glimpsed a life so strange

The drive for unconditional love
was stronger than all the others
I believed in you every day
It guides my every action
The obsessing body is your answer

Fell at the hands of hate
Another guide and friend
Stare at the wicked
Turn their backs on you

"Disappear"

We made the changes necessary to
Restore what was lost
And rise above the ebbing
Pain as I see you
I feel your shadow move right through me

Disappear
Let me go of my home
And forget all my troubles
There's too much going on inside
All those years deciding what to do (nowhere to go)
I'm too old to remember
What I wished would be the end

I'm drifting, like a ghost
In a forest of flesh
And mine's true identity
Will guide me to its source

Disappear
Let me go of my life
And forget all my troubles
There's too much going on inside
All those years deciding what to do (nowhere to go)
I'm drifting, like a ghost
In a forest of flesh
And mine's true identity
Will guide me to its source

"The Enemy Inside"

Overwhelmed with the questions demanded of me
Empty and bored
I fell into the trap of introversion
When introverted people are in, it's because they don't understand
We confuse philosophy and therapy
To make them want to cry

Disappear
Let me go of my life
And let my boredom disappear

And spend the summer in love with my stupid brother
I hope he will leave me be

"Spring MCMLXXIV"

Just when you thought you could not wait...
A flock of believers finds a new home
A young soul baptized
A waste of water for thirst
Lazarus burns before her eyes
