Lone hunter
Staring at the stars
Past, present and future
Unwelcome ones
All on the move
Nothing seems to stop him
He is everywhere I
Movement at blinding speed

Hold your light
Confrontation with the light
231 stillborn the light
Nothing ever achieves
Light up the sky
Eleven signs complete with words written on them all
Let them guide your way

Hold your light
Confrontation with the light
232 stillborn the light
Nothing ever achieves

Eleven signs complete with words written on them all
Let them guide your way

"By The Grace Of Angels"

The plagues that are buried beneath the ground
Relics of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their saviour's calling
Martyr's calling
Ascending to liberate mankind

Human harvest time has come
We're here
The moment humans deserve
The grace of angels
valeous hour of November

Calling upon the angels
To guard the gates
To help to make this dream a reality
A soldier is sent to save a free people
But a God is involved

Angels rise up
Redemption
For their savior
A headstone is erected
With the words "God be with you"
And fight for the world
With their savior
A simple yes or no

Can Angels Reach Out For Oneshots?
Are they reaching for one
And saving lives
All on the ground

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a human tragedy
Passing away
Without a doubt

Our prayers are answered
Our sympathy and our sympathy
It's time an answer be given
Just because the word has been put on the table
Does not mean that we will listen

[Chorus]
Thank you for your concern for us all
Dearest friend
We must keep these tragedies beneath our fingertips

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their savior
A headstone is erected
With the words "God be with you"
And fight for the world
With their savior
A simple yes or no

Can Angels Reach Out For Oneshots?
Are they reaching for one
And saving lives
All on the ground

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a human tragedy
Passing away
Without a doubt

Our prayers are answered
Our sympathy and our sympathy
It's time an answer be given
Just because the word has been put on the table
Does not mean that we will listen

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their savior
A headstone is erected
With the words "God be with you"
And fight for the world
With their savior
A simple yes or no

Can Angels Reach Out For Oneshots?
Are they reaching for one
And saving lives
All on the ground

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a human tragedy
Passing away
Without a doubt

Our prayers are answered
Our sympathy and our sympathy
It's time an answer be given
Just because the word has been put on the table
Does not mean that we will listen

"Arabelle's Burden"

It's so hard to get by
I get so much for free
And never feel like I'm getting away

Even when the pills I've been taking keep getting worse
I'm getting letters from doctors saying my heart is too slow
And doctors tell me to stop taking the pills

I'm getting calls from people saying their heart is too slow
They tell me to take them now
I'm getting calls from people saying their heart is too slow

Don't give up on yourself
Beware of the enemy inside
You'll never behead without rigorous treatment
You'll get what you need most
While mania keeps moving through the system
I won't pass up a better time

I stumble uponvocabulary
And find myself wanting
With each stumble I make

Systemic failure has made a fortune
And there's nothing I can do to curb the tide
Yet every failure seems ready for more

I struggle to hold on
Even when mystrength's slipping
I can't keep on running
'll anyone tell me what to say
and nowhere is calling me when I can't find you

"Crawl Away"

Crawled away from me.
Slipped away from me.
Tried to keep a hold,
But there was nothing I could say

It's all been an illusion,
He can't remember what he said
Just a number
