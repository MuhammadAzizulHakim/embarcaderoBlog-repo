======================================== SAMPLE 38 ========================================
May 21st

Overwhelmed as one with bad will
Shepherd of Winter's end

I feel no gain when I dine out
While the day is drawing to naught

I feel no gain when I relax
While the skies are shifting

"Beneath The Surface"

Is there ever really a right time?
You had led me to believe
Someday you'd be there for me
When the stars above aligned
When you weren't so consumed
I kept looking for the clues
So I waited in the shadows of my heart
And still the time was never right

Until one day I stopped caring
And began to forget why I longed to be so close
And I disappeared into the darkness
And the darkness turned to pain
And never went away
Until all that remained was buried, deep beneath the surface

A shell of what things could've been
Tired bones beneath a veil of guarded secrets all too frail
Sad to think I never knew
You were searching for the words
For the moment to emerge
Yet the moment never came
You couldn't risk my fragile frame

Until one day you stopped caring
And began to forget why you tried to be so close
And you disappeared into the darkness
And the darkness turned to pain
And never went away
Until all that remained was buried, deep beneath the surface

I would scream just to be heard
As if yelling at the stars
I was bleeding just to feel
But I would never say a word
Until one day I stopped caring
And began to forget why I longed to be so close
And I disappeared into the darkness
And the darkness turned to pain
And never went away
Until all that remained was buried, deep beneath the surface
Beneath the surface

"A Nightmare To Remember"

A nightmare to remember
I'd never be the same when it comes to skin
Blistering, characteristics that only a stupid, frightened child could conceivably
Understand

How could a kid be so indoctrinated
While his mother is seething and silent
This strange fascination
All but disappears
As his fever subsides

And still the nightmares keep on haunting her
Blistering, characteristics that only a stupid, frightened child could conceivably
Understand

"My Last Farewell"

I am unable to remember life
As I've slipped away
As I embrace you

I would choose to live and to flow
Without shame
As all those who mourned for me
Relieve for you

My last farewell
A fleeting memory
I hold in your arms
My final farewell
A fleeting memory
I hold in your arms

I am unable to remember life
As I've slipped away
As I embrace you

I fell for you so much, so hard
I tried to remain a prisoner
But as the darkness grew inside my heart
I knew I'd never leave you.
I fell for you so much, so hard
I tried to find your way out
But as the darkness grew inside my heart
I knew I'd never leave you.

And I would take comfort in knowing you
I should know, as you were hiding best
Even if I told you what I knew
Then maybe you would understand

"Open Car"

Nothing like this
Felt in her kiss
Cannot resist her
Fell for her charm
Swathed in shame

Spangled, expectant mother
Father, annulled

Lying in my pit
Wearing her heart to me
Nothing has been more overwhelmingly clear

Barren lands, crumbling
As I've turned to seek her forgiveness

Plunging toward tragedy
Staring down at the fallen
Waiting for a new day

Too much may never do for me
And it's not enough for you
I am broken, I can't move on
And my days are numbered

Nothing is sacred
Never can I bare to a sickness
Woe unto you, for you are made of me
Glorious death, glowing skin

"The Lines In My Hand"

I am drawing shadows again
