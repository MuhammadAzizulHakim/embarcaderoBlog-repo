inevitably.

He is mine,
He is not my slave nor am I under his command.
Neither am I under his command.
Neither am I under his command.

In loving memory of our child.
Remember my sixth of November.
And as we crow with discord
We are turning our backs on you little fellow.

[4x]
We are turning our backs on you little fellow.

"Nepenthe"

For a while I thought I fell asleep.
Sleep is a tricky thing.
It takes years of trial and careful observation.
And even more testing my faith is necessary.
Before I can begin I must go where no one knows
Where I might be.
I can't leave my home without risking my life.
I have no doubt, I would (!)
Wait for anyone and everyone around me
To say IÂ´m gone - and no-one knows
Where I might be.
There is nothing I would say
If someone said greeting me at sea
I would reply, "Of course you are."

And there I was kissing her
She was holding out a book
I had just given away
She looked up to me in the sky
Then she took my hand and led me through the gate
She had led me through the gates of insanity
Once she had made her light
Will she see she is the kind of girl
who lets her fear lie just beneath the surface?

And there I was lying down
With her crossed out face in the clear sky
She had me up to this wicked idea
Now she had me up to this wicked idea

I am wrong man
I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong
I am right
I am right now
And I am wrong

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden within
Open wounds hidden under my skin

Pain is real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Staring at me crying

I'm in the past, the present is me
But the person next to me is me
And when I look away
They are because of me

Under the fog of delusion
I am dreaming of the man I met when I was sleeping
In a forest unknown
The person next to me is me

"Wake Up"

It's hard to remember
When's the Best of Times
Now that I know
I'm not the man I thought I knew

It's hard to remember
When's the Best of Times
Now that I know
I don't remember,
I'm just a loonie
I hope I don't fall out of the sky
I hope I don't lose my cool

So wake up
Don't be afraid facing the unknown
You never can be right
Take control now
Don't let the world's unchecked events
Tell your smart phone toC

"Precarious Woes"

What can I say?
I've heard it all anyway

Somewhere like a good impression
I avoid the controversial
While in reality I find the words to be highly controversial

I may never find all the answers
Although I know there must be some
There's a town waiting
There's a reason why
I believed in you and we carried on

What can I say?
I've heard it all anyway

Somewhere like a good impression
I don't judge or question
While in reality I find the words to be highly controversial

I may never see all the answers
Although I know there must be some
There's a town waiting
There's a reason why
I believed in you and we carried on

What can I say?
I've heard it all anyway

"Hope In Ashes"

We walk through the park
Where the past is gone
And turn off the past

We will not grow, may not have what it takes
We have lost all we need
We lay the bones for our collective Dream

So imagine my surprise when
One morning while walking through the park
I look
