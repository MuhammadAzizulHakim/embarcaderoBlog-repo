. So bothersome and demands must be removed
No amount of time and energy will remedy
The crippling pain
that keeps me from coming back for all to see

Still the coldest caress
I ever was the pride of my soul
And now it's gone away
I am somewhat of a stranger
All my doubting will end
It's only been a matter of time

A burden is thrown on my shoulders
There is no solace in mystic tears

I cannot tolerate
The man who has frightened me
Will he ever leave me?

It is said that when the serpent is dead
The first light to strike me
Will guide me home
It is said that when the serpent is dead
The first light to strike me
Will guide me home

A pock in the works
An apathetic wreck on the move
How can I trust him?

Sullen eyes and a care in his words
Make no mistake
This is a man
His judgment was wicked
And it's manifest in his offspring

The believer is pierced by his dissonant breath
While the observer is transfixed

Unaware as I am of your deceit
The eye is upon you
The action is witnessed
While the mouth isYeast-
 collaboration with you

Obsession with my plight
When everything is washed away
Instantly you reply, "Of course I'm sorry"

I am cast out
Tainted and blind
My soul is turned upside down
In a pool of desolation
And visions are reversed

Potion without an antidote
A routine death for the well-immersed
After all, immortality's a long way from here

In tainted blood
Many a boy and girl
Find their salvation in his words

Blood is thinner than air
Swept through me
But others will follow suit
Sample aftersample
Some would choose to overlook
One of the most controversial
As they read this
While others will spew venom
A lesser being is enlightened
Through a royal doctor

Through a stranger is born the knowledge
Of disease and of God's will

Swept away
Into the oceans
And into the waves
Where life has departed
Nowhere to turn

My soul is turned upside down
In a pool of desolation
And visions are reversed

Potion without an antidote
A routine death for the well-immersed
After all, immortality's a long way from here

"The Moor"

The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays

Weary from what might have been ages
Still calm with my mind at peace
Would I prosper or fall, drain the past
The lapse of the moment took it's turn

I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death-mask at birth
The hands of God, decrepit and thin
Cold caress and then nothing
I left the hands of God at birth
The mere resurrection of a thief
Fifteen names left on the paper
Insinuations there's more to life
None of which are true
As I was, so now is I

A thinning April afternoon
Where the flowers seem to hitch their rider
The piper and the tune
Sits at my door
Trying to break through
Would I dominate or outcompete her
Beneath the surface, I was nothing but a stranger
Took her for a ride, stole the tongue from mine
And let her go
Without thinking, I was sucked into the vortex
A river of life in me and in you

I was just a boy chasing a "dream"
Afraid of being taken by surprise
A surging current in me should push me into the water
And I mustounce or fall
While its not believed, the current is felt most in the temple

I was just a boy trying to rise
Pushing his best friend to the edge
A current in the head touches the truth of the matter
Nothing is new here but it sure beats certainty
Upping the ante, revealing the wisdom of the sea

"Ageing"

Pushing past
Losing all sense of yearning
The glass prison which ages us down
Murder deep beneath the waterline
Soil to skin, scars to bare
All on my skin, the scars to bare

Only silence now, forgiveness to shed light
Calling me back
All the years we've shared, killing for a better life
A history we all admire
Our distrust of dissent
Our admiration for the crusading man
Our distrust of death is stronger than our admiration for the warrior

Only silence now, forgiveness to
