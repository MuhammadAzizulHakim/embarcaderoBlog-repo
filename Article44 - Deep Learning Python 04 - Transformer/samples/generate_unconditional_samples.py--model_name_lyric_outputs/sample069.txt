======================================== SAMPLE 69 ========================================
I've seen the problem here
It's our fault
If she can't change the pace
then we're in his debt

When he can't stop the car, she's not sure where
She waits like a ghost with nowhere to go
When the world lights
up
She's lost in the black

[Henry Rollins:]
You think you're so innocent
And believe what you're told
I hope the world finds
The reason behind your murder

"Bonnie The Cat"

Can't feel the pain that I expected
I still place keys in the ignition
I know what will be
One thought is stopping me from sleeping
I saw the future and it's breeding
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

There are three things that I would die for
But I am sure you're not one of them
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

[Henry Rollins:]
You think you're so innocent
And believe what you're told
I hope the world finds
The reason behind your murder

"Black Dahlia"

You have no interest in the past
Where you came from
Where you're going to

There's something in your heart so cruel
Don't give up hope on child

You have no interest in the past

"Spring MC3"

This is so hard for me
To find the words to say I love you
But I can't stop the memory running through me

I keep looking for the words to say
But I can't stop the feeling
Summer is miles away
And I may never get to know you

She keeps walking on eggshells
Throughths and summer is miles away

When I'm down
She keeps walking on eggshells
Throughting her story
She's taking us through the fall
When can we let her drop the past
And leave our past behind?

It's not hard to find
When Spring is miles away
And I may never get to know you

She keeps walking on eggshells
Throughting her story
She's taking us through the fall
When can we let her drop the past
And leave our past behind

"This Is Not A Time"

Coming undone
coming undone

Beneath the surface,
hidden in grey matter
Beneath the surface,
hidden in grey matter

Imagined in cinema
originally a blackened ghost
but became a scarlet letter at the hands of cinemagoer

I'm lying on a bed in a suburb of oculights
Seen it on the cover of a horror book
maybe it's the memory that gives it away
memory fading
and then the book I was reading was sold

I'm lying on a bed in a suburb of oculights
Seen it on the cover of a horror book
maybe it's the memory that gives it away

And she's running towards the door
I'm feeling low
And I'm feeling low
And I'm feeling low
And I'm feeling low
And I'm feeling low
And I'm feeling low

"Still Day Beneath The Sun"

There is a light that hits the gloom around
and the angel of balance that made you cry
besieged of your calm

But you are a worthless liar
and I know where you lieplode

You never will forget
you gave me your time
and I will fall for you
if I keep this promise

I will give you what I need most
You never will
But I will give you what you need most
You never will

Your stifling lust for children and the thought of losing her makes me dizzy
and leaves me withered
and left in a sea of poverty

And I had better things to do
than stumble again
and bored myself with misery

Your shallow words and degrading behavior
have left me numb
and left me without a voice
And left me without a soul
And left me without a mind

Much to your advantage
I lived before you ventured forth
My friend Baldrick led the way
Now he sees the light at the end of the tunnel
I fooled with your kind of deeds
into thinking I am more than that

Feeling helpless and questioning
I walked away
from reaching out and helping
to turn a corner
Reaching for the cause
It
