Why don't you both run? [repeat]

Why don't you both run? [repeat]

Because I want to feel the change
I need to see your face
And I doubt you could
Feel the same
Why don't you both run? [repeat]

Running is risky
Running too far
And leaving too little
For you to live, I fear

"Untethered Angel"

You've built this world around you
Using your mistakes, your failures
As fuel for your demons
Untethered angel inside

It's unclear why you feel rejected
Angel bleeding for the praise
Said I wrong

Falling back to earth
Getting stronger every day
Fighting for what's left
Changing who we are

Untethered angel inside

Why don't you just let it go
Just let it go
You're the one who's testing the waters
The rest is up to you

"WTUR"

What's your take on the X-Files who ran the complex simulations?
What did you think of the series when it came time to tune out the boredom?

I was struck by how emasculate gentleman and his spirit
Had I known at the time that I loved him then
Maybe I'd have stayed
Butted heads with respect to the show

Why don't you step out of your own self pitying
Take what's left and move on
Leave it be

We all fall
If we weren't so bold
Brave, we'd be invincible
Just a bunch of junkies
Terminally disturbed and detached

Who'd you be if you weren't so desperate
Looking for something new and cold and sad?
You're the X-Files pilot

And I'm the man who'll lead you to that point
How can I feel abandoned even when the rest is bleak?

Don't blame me if you want to find the truth
But I'm the man who'll lead you to that point
How can I feel abandoned even when the rest is bleak?

Don't blame me if you want to find the truth
But I'm the man who'll lead you to that point
How can I feel abandoned even when the rest is bleak?

"Such a Reckless Offer"

Spark directly in my head
Destroying trust in me, leaving me in a state of disconnection
Endless despair within reach
Typical simpletons out there
Getting ahead in life simply for the sake of it
They don't understand the damage that can be done
When a light comes on that makes me forget, it's even more perplexing

Such a risky idea
Certainly fulfills two very narrow desires
Pale horse rider through famine
A man who has always had a strong faith in me

"Once Less"

We barely remember the last time we were apart
We drift in and out of consciousness
And never returning again

Lost soul with a thirst for revenge
Never able to shake the trauma of abuse
Time keeps passing by
And the memories start to move

We barely remember the last time we were apart
We drift in and out of consciousness
And never returning again

"Collapse The Light Into Earth"

I may be nothing all alone
I've exposed the darkness within
Yet I be the victim of my own prejudice

I may be nothing all alone
I've exposed the darkness within
Yet I be the victim of my own prejudice

I'm living up to my name
Content to let tragedy take its toll
On and on and on and on it goes

Until one day I stopped caring
And began to forget why I longed to be so close
And I disappeared into the darkness
Again

Collapse the Light Into Earth

"The Silent Man"

A quiet angel caught in the heavy pull of the traffic
Shows us where he might have
