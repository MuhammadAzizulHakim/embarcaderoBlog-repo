And scar the ground
If necessary, to get through the day

See his back is turning
Now it's time to CRASH
Crushing glass and shattered buildings
Embers raining down
Roads closing in on downed motorists
As he falls
Behind the wheel the red light will begin to blink

[V. Intervals]

Headline news: A military judge has thrown out the murder conviction

Judges hear all who press
for innocence
Murder's guilt's not proof
Conviction still controversial
In light of this development
(V. The Drugs War)

No one should ever know
that Dr. Pepperz is alive and well
This fatal meeting place
is a vehicle for the wealthy
and the nucleus of the elite
Everyone knows Dr.
Pepsi
is in a meeting all set?
No, he's not!

Now they tell me what to do
I start the ignition, looks in the mirror
Will I drive on lake Huron?
No I don't doctor you when I need you the most

Motorist waiting for a slow car
Will he be waiting for you, my friend?

[VI. Funeral]

He was a part of me
He gave his life for the cause
for which you are searching
He was 90 years old
Now he'll be laughing at parties all around the world

Funeral procession through the city
With music and smiles on its grave

You would search his memory
No luck
unless you tried to understand
The music played no part
In favour of the cause

I die alone
For all that I have lost
And leave behind
It leaves no doubt
In memory of him who was in the
pain

Waiting for a lullaby
He was alone in his room
Lying on the shelf
No one seemed to understand
He had lost his desire
To sing this farewell
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart

He was someone alone
He turned and walked away
With music and smiles on its grave

Waiting for a lullaby
He was alone in his room
Lying on the shelf
No one seemed to understand
He had lost his desire
To sing this farewell
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart

"All Things Will Pass"

Rose of Summer, withered times
Shadows fall on contouring lines
Dig a little deeper
And hope infuse the darkness
With a touch of poison

Dead within a dream
Icy river flows over me
Leading to me and ending there

All things will pass
When they'll pass
By my home
The edge of my soul

Dead within a dream
Icy river flows over me
Leading to me and end there
All things will pass
When they'll pass my soul

"Nepenthe"

Hope would fail me
And at the end of this day despair would triumph

The deceiver said, "You will see"
The apostle lies sleeping
In a land of confusion

She said, "I will weep"
The devil and his angels fly

[Ephesus:]
With all the words I have learned
I believe in him

All things will pass
When they will pass
By my side
The apostle lies sleeping
In a land of confusion

[Den of Weeps:]
He is a comfort to me
And a nightmare to me
He seems to be marching on

He said, "You will see"
The church and the prophets talk but never read
They must be watching me all the way to the sky

[Spoken Apostles:]
"I will go down beside you
And pray to her forever
For her innocence and beauty
And help to give me strength to carry on

I think it's the time of the Savior's death
That this man should die at his hands

[Arabelle:]
He was aching with all his might
But never could he see her
He was a hopeless liar
Always searching for the truth

[Den of Weeps:]
He was abandon all his might
He was aold bastard who couldn't take his anger
Outside he was apeace and love wreck

[Spoken Apostles:]
"The truth will set free this hopeless liar
He can't face another day
It will be his fate

We have come to make him free
But it remains a long way to go
