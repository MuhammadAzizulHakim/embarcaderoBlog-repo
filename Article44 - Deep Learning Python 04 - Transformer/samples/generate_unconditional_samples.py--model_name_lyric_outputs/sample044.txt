======================================== SAMPLE 44 ========================================
I'm finding the dirt, the way it ends
I'm defining what I'm to
Find the truth behind this verse.

"Feel So Low"

I fell so low
So high
So soon
It's over
And I don't know where I'm going

Leave your thoughts at my door
Take my hand and we'll fly

Down with the world at my feet
Feel so low
So low
Feel so low

Leave your thoughts at my door
Leave your thoughts at my door
Leave your thoughts at my door

"Don't Hate Me"

A light snow is falling on London
All sign of the living has gone
The train pulls into the stations
And no-one is left, just the commuters

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't fight me
I know you'll never care
Can I call you on the telephone, now and then?

One light burns in a window
It guides all the shadows below
Inside the ghost of a parting
And no-one is left, just the commuters

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't fight me
I know you'll never care
Can I call you, I'm terrified

"This Is No Rehearsal"

How many children did I bring into this world?
How many did I lose in the shopping arcade?

This is no rehearsal - play it back
and throw things at the screen
This is no rehearsal - somebody
interpret this for me

And still I remember how I dressed him this morning
And then he was gone - stolen, my only one

"Baby Dream In Cellophane"

I am - in my pram
Look you - I'm so new I am - sleeping there
Underneath the stairs

If you - wanted to
You'd find - inside my mind
Things so surreal
My lips are sealed

In the rain in cellophane
Pale dogs and demigods
They're my shadow
Tearing apart the dreams
That once held me

And now I'm back inside my own mind
It's calling me
It's calling me, La Traviata
It's calling me, La TraviA

"The Start Of Something Beautiful"

I was expecting...
The start of something beautiful
Changing everything

I was expecting the blackest dream
I was expecting the feeling of rape and torture
I was expecting the memory loss that comes when you're older

I was expecting the memory loss that comes when you're older and expecting the same
I was expecting the feeling of sleep and the rape of your own flesh
I was expecting the feeling of pain and the relaxation
I was expecting the feeling of sleep and the relaxation
I was expecting the feeling of sleep and the relaxation

"Glass Arm Shattering"

Feeling all your touching
Feeling all your blood
Feeling all your touching
Feeling all your love

It's so warm inside
I can't remember what have you done to me
I wonder if I'm not yours

I'm so familiar with your looks
I remember when you took my hand and led me through the coldest memories
Then you put your hand on my throat
And kissed me on the lips
That was all you said
No more rape and torture
No more nightmares
I'm begging you now to forgive me

I'm so familiar with your hair and makeup
It's so well done
It's any age
But I remember when you made me feel ugly
I'm so old and numb
It's no wonder you gave me problems
My advice to you would be to split the brain

I'm so familiar with your looks
I remember when you took my hand and led me through the coldest memories
Then you moved on to make me feel ugly
I remember when you told me how sorry I is
And then you turned the episode back on
So don't judge me
I'm tired of this shit
It's over now
Time to move on
I'm so unfamiliar with your moods
Everything seems so foreign
And even though I enjoy being around you
I don't think I understand why

When I'm down I ride the spiral of fear
While you're down you're grateful for the chance

I'm so familiar with your looks
I remember when you took my hand and led me through the coldest memories
Then you moved on
