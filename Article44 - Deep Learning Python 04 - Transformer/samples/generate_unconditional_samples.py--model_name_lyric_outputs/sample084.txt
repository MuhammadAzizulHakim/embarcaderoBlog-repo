I may fall, but I never'll be alone
Where angels waken with a kiss
And love ones that died for you

"Voices"

'Love, just don't stare'
He used to say to me
Every once in a while
The only thing that matters now is how it ends

I can't remember how
I got into this life, but it's always been the same
When I hear your voice I know I'm in for a surprise

I may just waste away from doing nothing
But I could never be alone
What would you say to that?

I love you very much

Voices always listen
On occasion they'd just be told
'Love, just don't stare.'
'That doesn't make them any less human'
That's exactly what I would say
Would that be wrong?

It's just a mistake, it's just a mistake
Their thoughts, their thoughts
Just gotta percolate out
And keep going
Through all that has been lost

I may just waste away from doing nothing
But I could never be whole
What would you say to that?

I love you very much

Voices always listen
On occasion they'd just be told
'Love, just don't stare.'
'That doesn't make them any less human'
That's exactly what I would say
Would that be wrong?

It's just a mistake, it's just a mistake
Their thoughts, their thoughts
Just gotta percolate out
And keep going
Through all that has been lost

I may just waste away from doing nothing
But I could never be whole
What would you say to that?

I love you very much

Voices always listen
On occasion they'd just be told
'Love, just don't stare.'
'Love, just don't stare.'

"Nine Cats"

The butterfly sailed on the breeze
Past a field of barbed wire trees
Where golden dragons chased around
Pampered poppies on the ground
Two silver trout sat way on high
And watched a royal samurai
Plant two black orchids in a box
And strap it to a laughing fox
A minstrel bought a crooked spoon
He gave it to a blue baboon
Who filled it full of virgin snow
And watched it in the afterglow

Fat toad stood in his ballet shoes
Teaching sixteen kangaroos
How to skip across a lake
They found it hard to stay awake
A pharaoh played a merry tune
And watched nine cats dance on the moon
I didn't know what all this meant
I didn't know why I'd been sent.

The Insignificance version of Nine Cats has the
following additional verse at the end:

I threw 5 clocks down on my bed
The chimes danced out on golden threads
And turned to footprints on my wall
Sequined tears began to fall

"Footprints"

I saw her footprints on the sea
I knew her eyes were watching me
So I ventured further in my mind
In the hope that I would find:

"Tangerine Trees and Marmalade Skies and
Plasticine Porters with Looking Glass Ties"

My mind had formed a mental prison
I cried aloud no-one would listen
Then floating through the heavy mist
My vision took a sudden twist

Empty people stood in grey
Children laughing far away
An empty courtyard weathered with snow
Rain lashed down on darkened stone

A crystal glove points to the door
A threshold I had crossed before
On turning back all I could see
Were her footprints on the sea.

"Linton Samuel Dawson"

Linton Samuel Dawson
Lives in inner space
He hangs around with a circus troupe
Outside the human race

Linton Samuel Dawson
Has just reached 25
Artists travel from outside time
Just to see his rainbow jive

He's bored, He's bored.

Linton Samuel Dawson
Yields his knowledge in a phial
A vivid play on an emerald day
I s experienced in his smile

Linton Samuel Dawson
Visits many open minds
He aids escape to tranquility
From the boredom of his solitary life

Boredom. From the boredom.
From the boredom of his solitary life

"And The Swallows Dance Above The Sun"

I'm sitting in the concrete
I'm listening for a heartbeat
I'm sitting in the painting
I promised I'd be waiting
I'm
