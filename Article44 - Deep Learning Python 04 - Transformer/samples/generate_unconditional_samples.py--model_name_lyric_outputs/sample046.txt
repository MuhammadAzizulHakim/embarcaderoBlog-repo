Next up.

Nervousness kicks in.
It's like sirens going off.
Fear takes over.
Finally I can be where I want to be.

I get up from the ground up.
I get rides in cars,
I get high, I get sober.
I get high, I get sober.

And then Fear takes over.
And I'm nowhere but me.
And I
Finally
I can be where I want to be.

I get up from the ground up.
I get rides in cars,
I get high, I get sober.
I get high, I get sober.

And then Fear takes over.
And I'm nowhere but me.
And I
Finally
I can be where I want to be.

I get up from the ground up.
I get rides in cars,
I get high, I get sober.
I get high, I get sober.

"Fall Into The Light"

Written on the water
Memories dissipate
Eyes begin to open
Darkness drifts away

Lonely silhouettes wither
Men in royal clothes
Black as holes and oceans
Others wielding calumny
Tales of treason
Outside Conspiracies crumble
Conspiracies born of doubt
False faith pushes the boundaries

In the shadow of the moon
Confessions painted on the wall
Honesty in the necrology

Light dims before the sun
Scars and dangers pile up
In the light of the moon

<|endoftext|>

"Space Transmission"

Your pharaoh
Your sun god
A position of trust

Your desires respected
Un sanctioned sex
Driven under the yoke of guilt
Porn stars shine
Schools full of kids
And their parents
For love of flesh and blood

<|endoftext|>

"Free Moon"

You're gonna like this one a lot
Because it shows how
You felt when you stood up
To stare the problem right in the eye

Rollin' 'round
Turnin' round
'Cause this fuckin' thing is gonna grow (literally)

Feelin'' round
Turnin' round
'Cause this thing is gonna grow (literally)

Feelin' round

'Cause this thing is gonna grow (literally)

All you know is happiness
All you can do is wish it away

"Space Transmission"

You've got this feeling
Even when the fever turns to love
When the dream becomes a reality
And when the two become one
It's one feeling
It's unconditional love that we carry

When we think of love
Nothing seems to keep us together
And when the two become one
It's unconditional love that we carry

And when the two become one
It keeps us safe
Even when the fever turns to hate
It's got nothing on us
And it's got nothing on us like trust
It's got nothing on us like me

It's not love that keeps me sane
It's love that keeps me sane
It's love that keeps me sane
It's love that keeps me sane
Give it up for me
Give it up for me
I can't lose you
Don't let this one
Two more years
Give it up for me
I'll always keep you
And I can't lose you
Don't let this one
Two more years
Give it up for me
I'll always keep you
And I can't lose you
Don't let this one
Two more years
Give it up for me
I can't lose you
Don't let this one
Two more years
Give it up for me
I can't lose you
Don't let this one
Two more years
Give it up for me
I can't lose you
Don't let this one
 Two more years

Feeling strangers staring back at me
They all seemed to feel strangers staring back at me
