======================================== SAMPLE 16 ========================================
I am void of myself
And all my thoughts are vain's bluff
I am the sort who can't remember thoughts
Forfeit the moment to ponder

When will I get over
I was drifting in and I saw no sign of you

Dying
It's a matter of moments
I will be reaching for the light
You stare right past me in darkness

You were my own picking when I fell asleep
Your hands reaching up to light
As I round you in the dark
I will pick the one that's left for me
Your smile spreading across the whole screen
It will be the one for you
My dear one don't you cry
It will be the one for you too

When will I get over
I was drifting in and I drowned it all in my song
You reached up to light when you lay me down
But nothing ever came close to me
To release all my feelings
So I would tend to my own lonely boy
In the light that flows through
Sole provider of my life

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And begins to sing
It's a beautiful tale
No one can save you
If they don't believe in you

You're on your own
There's no one who can save you
If all you've done
Is scare the child away
And dull the mind

Nothing you say will bring him back

Sealed the innocence of your heart
Sooled over a lifetime
Born the curse of secrecy
The pressure from self-indulgent control
For the first time in his life

Blood fueled on a hot sunny day
Nothing seemed real
Will Derek ever see his father again

Sealed the innocence of your heart
Sooled over a lifetime
Born the curse of secrecy
The pressure from self-indulgent control
For the first time in his life

Sealed the innocence of your heart
Sooled over a lifetime
Born the curse of secrecy
The pressure from self-indulgent control
For the first time in his life

Sealed the innocence of your heart
(It's time for your reckoning)
Sooled over a lifetime
And knows he's never the same

"Hours Of Wealth"

Found a way to rid myself clean of pain
And the fever that's been haunting me
Has gone away

Looking through my window
I seem to recognize
All the people passing by
But I am alone
And far from home
And nobody knows me

Never heard me say goodbye
Never shall I speak to anyone again
Solas, over prayer and roses
Showing me the way
that I've always been to be
And the pride I've shown
shows me the way
Through my heart
And so proud I seem
To be turning away

Looking through my window
I seem to recognize
All the people passing by
But I am alone
And far from homeAnd nobody knows me
Never heard me say goodbye
Never shall I speak to anyone again
Solas, over prayer and roses
Showing me the way
that I've always been to be
And the pride I've shown
Jealous, insecure, ruthless
Have I ever been wrong?

I'm falling apart
Looking through my window
I seem to recognize
All the people passing by
But I am alone
And far from homeAnd nobody knows me
Never heard me say goodbye
Never shall I speak to anyone again
Solas, over prayer and roses
Showing me the way
that I've always been to be
And the pride I've shown
Jealous, insecure, ruthless
Have I ever been wrong?

I'm falling apart
Looking through my window
I seem to recognize
All the people passing by
But I am alone
And far from homeAnd nobody knows me
Never heard me say goodbye
Never shall I speak to anyone again
Solas, over prayer and roses
Showing me the way
that I've always been to be
And the pride I've shown
Self-centered, vindictive
I'm falling apart
Looking through my window
I seem to recognize
All the people passing by
But I am alone
And far from homeAnd nobody knows me
Never heard me say goodbye
Never shall I speak to anyone again
Solas, over prayer and roses
Showing me the way
that I've always been to be
And the pride I've shown
Self-centered, vindictive
I'm falling apart
Looking through my window
I seem to recognize
All the people passing by
But I am alone
And far from homeAnd nobody knows me
Never heard me say goodbye
