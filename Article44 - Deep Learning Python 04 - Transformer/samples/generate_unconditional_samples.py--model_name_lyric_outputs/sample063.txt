Don't be afraid, Gabriel!

"A Farewell To The Twilight Before Me"

My last farewell
As you made your way to freedom
Through the trees
Ooooh and the kiss of friendship
That sealed your fate

My hand is yours now
My heart is bound now
My will be broken now

Brother will you cry if you don't
If your destiny's worth surviving

Evangeline
I'm learning to hate
And fear the light of truth
Though I'll never trust you

Evangeline
I'm learning to despise
And hate the truth
Though I'll never trust you

"Brother The Creator"

[INT. Creator's Hideyuum - Night]

[Faythe:]
In the name of tradition
We worship the departed
But at the same time we worship truth

For the creator of this wondrous creation
Has gone astray
Oblivious
He sheds his light
On the wicked
And left undone

[Narrator:]
As the night went on
Into the darkness
Hideyuum rose to his announce
As night went on
Hideyuum gave his all
To gain entry to the darkness

[Arhys:]
As a symbol of power and might
And a symbol of freedom
My brother's renouncement
Answering the call
To fight for their dreams

"The Seventh Sojourn"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Eleven]

In the darkness of this day
The Creator's hideyuum
Riding the ascent
To the summit of his tower
To glory and serenity
It all seems to pass before he falls
Upon the earth
What he needs most
Is an instantiated mind

As a boy he went wandering
But now he's reached the pinnacle
Where stark allegorical contrasts
Scream forthlessly at the moon
His blaze spreading like a lightning bolt

Blending together with the light
That carries him
All the way there
To the summit of his tower
To glory and serenity
It all seems to pass before he falls
Upon the earth
What he needs most
Is an instantiated mind

Blurring the lines between art and religion
He is like a moth burned by the fire
He knows no bounds
He is like a stepping stone
Being walked through the air
But he will not reach the summit of his tower
Until he reaches here

"The Fatal Brothers"

[INT. Reginald's Hideyuum - Night]

[Faythe:]
When I'm down I can see
His face is shaking with grief
And I know he's lost his innocence
I know he's never wanted a sight of my life
But somehow they keep forging
A brother's enigma for us to see

Blood...He used to be afraid to be alone
But now he's taken his own life into his own hands
Murder always rewards the chase

I've honor and I'm fearless
I'm brave and
