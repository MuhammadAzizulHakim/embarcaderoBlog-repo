======================================== SAMPLE 86 ========================================

Overheard me talking on the wind
Overheard me talking on the wind

(To)
The man
With the gold watch
His voice was vast and loud
Like the battle cry
Every man for his life
Soldier of the year

"In The Presence Of Enemies, Pt. 1"

[I Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[II Resurrection]

The soul gets tired
And these cold senses get in the way
And death's a burden God faces
In His grace we seek
In His truth we're inspired

How can we be sure we're doing
This toil for our salvation?
I feel I'm getting nowhere
And this is all to blame

The word with whom I speak
has no place
Here I can't laugh
At the mention of my name
Here I can't rage
But off the cuff I can'tiege

I can't justify
Taking things on faith
But loose from my heart
Can't admit that I'm wrong

I can't seem to find the strength
To carry on with this stupid, thin shell of me

How can I live with this
Being all alone and loss
Forced into a life that's too short?

Feeling hopeless and new
Being in the presence of a stranger
All that I need is someone to hold me in
I feel like giving up
All my ambitions to others
It's futile to think of me as a man
And I don't want to end...

"Fear Of A Blank Planet"

Sunlight coming through the haze
No gaps in the blinds
To let it inside
The bed is unmade,
Some music still plays

TV, without subtitles,
Shows a trailer for a new film
No subtitles, no silent auctions
To see what's on the DVD

I'm a stranger inside
The light comes on
The noise from the bedroom
Is like a cancer bed "oh my my my my my my my"

No drugs, no guns
No IMAGES OF THE DAY

The stranger inside
The most frightening man
A man who'll shiver your heart and mind

You don't know which way
When the flood is raging
You just might have to stay
But you can't know which way

Turn yourself into the water
Turn yourself into the water
Turn yourself into the water

You are fearless, never afraid
Begging for mercy, never surrender
Knowingly following orders
From God and the prophets

Run while the blind is open
Eyes open

School outrun by insects
Bathing pool behind
See how I survive

Without religion I wouldn't have to admit
Without power, I wouldn't have to admit
Without fear, I wouldn't have to admit
Without truth, I wouldn't know which way

In these grave and crowded rooms
There's never a sound
There's never a light
There's never a sun
Or a tide
Or a tide
But of some other feeling

Say what you want about the gods
But who's Ig Nobel Prize winning
And who'd win this fight

I got what I wanted
I got everything I wanted
I got mine
Now I'm mining for gold

"Attack Of The New Millennium"

[reversed lyrics 2:03-2:22:]
"You try to get away from this, you try to find your way back home again"

If there's one thing that I enjoy, it ruins
So I found a way to stop this, this is going away
And I saved this for a dream that could never come true
And I collected all the things I couldn't see
And I put them in a thick book
That I own by my side, so don't take it for granted

I thought that I could control this, this is so very, very hard to find
I thought that I could give away all my books
And that I could watch all my friends disappear
I thought that I could send them back
But no, my books don't store anything...

I've heard the old saying...
All that I need is love
And love
When I hear the way it burns inside my chest
I'm gonna lose all loyalty
And all faith I have in myself

I'm gonna burn like a poor girl
This way and shoot like a blackbird
I'm gonna kill like a lunatic
I'm gonna blow up my way to power

"Collapse The Light Into Earth"

And I hear it through the window
And through the glass
