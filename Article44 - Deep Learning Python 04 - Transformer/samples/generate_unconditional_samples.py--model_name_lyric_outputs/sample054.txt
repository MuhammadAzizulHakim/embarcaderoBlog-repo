======================================== SAMPLE 54 ========================================
As I walk you through my poetry

Tell me once again

How can I feel abandoned and never found the strength to carry on
When my own image's inspired me

Nocturnally sad
And there's no turning back

It saddens me to know
The helplessness you feel
That's why you should raise your voice

Proven hopelessness over metropolis skyline
It's time for your reckoning

[indistinct]

Way off in the distance I saw a sign
Breaking beneath the sun
None of us spoke
But all moved along
Like autumn leaves folded in half

Along with the silence
And the long days
I passed through
Straight ahead toward the edge of our dreams
And the barrenness reached its zenith

Signal up for battle
Worlds collide, outpace thoughts
And defragments ablaze

"By The Pain I Remember"

I was once again left behind
Wondering where to start
Tired muscles used to pain
Resting in the coldness of my disconnection

There's nothing I can do for you today
He went into battle heartbroken
A broken man moved into a new chapter
Growth black to golden

"Patterns In The Ivy 2"

I remember an innocent girl dying
Her voice was so loud
I didn't understand
I felt so helpless

I felt so much uncertainty
Why I couldn't cry

In the year of her loss
2016 marked the end of a chapter
I wrote of her worth to mankind
the storyteller would depart
As I write this letter
I stillear with fleeting memories
of a night I knew well

I&M were envious
Of what might have been
Had we met
Maybe we would've laughed and cried

Close to midnight
We walked beside the lake
Where flowers die by the wayside
And deep in thought we moved long past

Once we believed
We were guided
By love and reason
Through this sacred lake
It all changed
As night turned to the freezing rain
And as morning went down
With her broken heart in my arms

"Hope Leaves"

In the corner beside my window
There hangs a lonely photograph
There is love in it all

She whispers something in the glass
I turn and look inside

I remember I&M always staying inside
It's so hard to say goodbye
It's almost like I got cancer

And as I've walked away
I've cried
Much easier to forget

In the years that followed
I learned about her life
By looking through her eyes

As I smile
She wonders what it's like for her to lose her
Hope leaves a scar across my life
It's a hole that she has to crawl
She'll never know she've lost her
When she wakes up tomorrow
I'll search the memory
She left a note in the glass
She'll remember today

"You Remember Me"

I'm knowing another day
And tonight
I'll be forever grateful
To see another day

Strength and innocence
Burning through the night
As night turns into day

You couldn't ask for a better way
A way that wouldlete last
Untie these strings
As IKEA retro victory dance

I'm knowing another day
And tonight
I'll be forever grateful
To see another day

"Even Less (Full Version)"

A body is washed up on a Norfolk beach
He was a friend that I could not reach
He thought I was cold but I understand
But for the grace of god goes another man

And as IKEA retro victory dance
A body is buried on the sea
Where deadwing freaks take their turns

And then a while ago
I heard from a friend that his guitar
Was worth a fortune
Even though it's just a memory
He seems to hold no grudges
He even gave me his hand
And said, "If you want to see the end of this world, you'll only have to wait a while"

Even more than love
Even though it's about to rain
And only a few months have expired

Even though it's about to keep raining
And only a few months have expired

Even though it's only a memory
And nothing's changed in this lifetime

And still I keep on thinking
While hundreds of children cry in sadness

Even though it's about to rain and only a few months have expired

Even though it's about to keep raining and only a few months
