======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
You`re tuning in!
Drifting in a totally new direction|
Someone`s lost their voice

Every now and again I`d catch the train
It always seems to make me feel so lonely
And I always wonder if I`m missing out|

Why can`t we call him when you`re everywhere?|
It`s just another day, just another day
It doesn`t seem like a good time|
I tried all the things with you, I tried with you
But nothing beats the moment we`re inside
It`s highly recommended

I try not to care
And I still carry strong emotions
(...)
I`ve to hide better
To face my darkest days

When did we all lose our will?
When was the last time?|

"Scene Nine: Finally Free"

[Intro:]
Scene Nine: Finally Free

[Nervous laughter]
We`ll never know
How the splinter
Suck me now
Creep inside me
Euphoric lust for death
Noone's innocent until they`m turned inside

How can I feel abandoned even when the whole world surrounds me
When will this end?
When can I trust death alone?

I`ve tried many things, but nothing seems to work
I`ve tried all that I`ve got
And nothing seems to make it go away

It doesn`t make any sense
All that matters now
Is who I am

"S10E: Blinding Shadows"

[ENGLISH:]
As you can see from the closing seconds
I am a murderer.
You can see his face burning
With love in your eyes

The final word was never a warning
A harlot for humanity
A sorceress of the eye
For she once was meek and guarded

I am not innocent.
I have lied many times
And still I am a murderer
I will never play this game

I am a prisoner of regret
Of hatred and pain
I am a transgressing sorceress
I am forgiven if I repent

I once believed that death was the end
Yet nothing I have done has ever relieved me of this guilt
Revealing in glass prison clothes
For now I am a prisoner of regret

"Benighted"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Benighted]

Xander and Gabriel
Lead the way
They are fearless
Lead the way through the night
Fighting the fear within

Lead the way
They are fearless
Lead the way through the night
Fighting the fear within

Blinding shadows
Searing beams of light
Pain as shadows are wiped away
Scarcely a flicker of light

As they pass a view from the other side
They will look to envy and pain
They will gaze into the darkness

Like a wandering amazon
Sentimental father
Withstanding all the pain
He will gaze into the darkness

"Eternal Rains Will Come"

[EXT. Heaven's Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Denial|Ensemble:]
People, can you hear me?
Crying? cries out
Help me cure him
That's me
Not you
People, I can't hear you
Until I take your money
And put a blindfold on you

He's a worthless liar
Talking about your love
You can't blame him for that

People, he's just an outcast
Not much of a friend
He's never had a problem
He's just thin air

He's a martyr for chaos
He'll blow his cover
And outman his soldiers
Just to name a few

But I'm counting out the fire
As I see his ugly face
Blind men are upon me
And I can't help but pity his pain
I can't help but pity his pain

But I'm counting out the fire
As I see his ugly face
Blind men are upon me
And I can't help but pity his pain
I can't help but pity his pain

But I'm counting out the fire
As I see his ugly face
Blind men are upon me
And I can't help but pity his pain
I can't help but pity his pain

"They Don't Know"

[EXT. Heaven's Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Narrator:]

Under the glow of the midnight moon
Where the stars touch
Stand the long held secrets of the Van
