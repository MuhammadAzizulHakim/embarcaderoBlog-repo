"Undertow"

Two times in.

I've been struck dumb by a voice that
speaks, from deep beneath peerless water that's,
twice as clear as heaven,
twice as loud as reason.
Deep and rich like silt on a riverbed,
just as neverending, just as the sun sets forever in eclipse of this precious mark of ourselves.
And then, a voice inside my head,
heard me blink
and said...

"You are thinking alike of people and things and
what if all of them were dead?"

That's just the kind of question
that I would have asked.
But I don't think I asked it often enough.
Do you know the kind of question
that you are thinking like a lunatic?
Would you rather be gone than try your best to stay alive?

It has always been my fate
to try and still find the light inside,
and still have the hunger and the the the the nerve to carry on with this meaningless life I'm leading here
now.

I will always remember
the smell of stale meat on the burnt charcoal
and the vivid sight that we made of arms on the table
as we talked about our silly little adventure last night.

But it will never be enough for me.
I will never enough be enough for you.
It is our last hope and our last friend.
It is our only hope and our only friend.

"Transcending Time"

Drifting in a far off place
I roam the countryside
Seeking wings of thought
Waiting in the blind

Enchanted and transfixed
I am pulled into the still
By a backward ticking clock
Held against my will

Illusions turn to dust
Scatter trails of silver light
Like reflections from the projected demise
Of a vesselwrecked in the distance

Signals in the mist
Altered state of mind
Stars in the abyss
Transcending time

Midnight in the garden
Digging for a spark
Where seeds of inspiration
Lie buried in the dark

Attention starts to wonder
As the poet lifts his pen
And the critic from within
Is silenced once again

Limits leave no trace
Ashes in the rain
Lost and far away

Signals in the mist
Altered state of mind
Stars in the abyss
Transcending time

Signals in the mist
Stars in the abyss

Euphoric obsession
Without conscious intention
Being pulled by the current
On a vesselwrecked in the distance

Signals in the mist
Stars in the abyss

Transcending time
Transcending time
Transcending time
Transcending time

"Awaken the Master"

Finding your way
On a frozen path where the air is thin
The angel of balance
Keeps you alive

The most precious things a master can do
Take what you can and deliver it to his beloved

You are born into a bad life
Moved by destiny into a better life
Then you reach out and touched everyone

In a moment of weakness
You target yourself
Ignorant or brave
Struggling to carry on

You are forgiven on this day
If you choose to honor your test
With glory and peace of mind

To carry out your destiny
Lured into sin
Awaken the master
(Honor your test)
