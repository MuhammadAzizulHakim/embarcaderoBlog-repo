======================================== SAMPLE 7 ========================================
Give me a ride on my own
Reveal the tragedy
And blot out the memory
With vivid vignettes of pain and triumph
Scan the skies with my eyes
And maybe you'll connect

Behind the looming lighthouse
The wild children dance in the
wind
And poolside dim lights
Take my hand and we'll fly

Seasons change and so can I
Can you remember 'til now
From the finest tales
Toagiographical tastes

"In My Time Of Need"

I can't remember happiness
I've spent so long
On someone who isnt there

She's rejected me all she can
But I can't break out
And I can't lose you

Through all the smashing glass
And the screaming dogs
I've seen the future
And I can't wait to leave

And I can't wait to move onto

It's been a while...

I can't remember happiness
I've spent so long
On someone who's not there

She's rejected me all she can
But I can't wait to move onto

It's been a while
And she's ready to leave me now
It's been a while
For she changed to feel the same

I can't remember happiness
I've spent so long
On someone who's not there

He seemed alone and lost
And all his days are wasted
She turned to him with a knowing smile

I can't remember happiness
I've spent so long
On someone who's not there

"Sleeping Giant"

Some will be driven by conflict
Others will fight the good fight
Some will rely on the darkness
Some will rely on the light

Embrace the light
Stay connected
Don't be afraid to be alone

There will be moments of doubt
When I don't know where I stand
When I really have to know

When will I walk the plank to sea
The clarity of the solitary voice
Helping me understand my plight

There is a burden that I cannot ignore
There is a need that I cannot ignore

There is a sacrifice that I cannot ignore
There is a sacrifice that I can't tolerate
There is a pain that I cannot live with
There is a sacrifice that I cannot live with

There is a candle's fire burning
But I can't see the ground
As I get closer

There are moments of doubt
When I don't know where I stand
And when I really have to know

When will I walk the plank to sea
The clarity of the solitary voice
Helping me understand my plight

There is a burden that I cannot unnoticed
There is a need that I cannot bear
There is a need that I cannot love

There is a candle's fire burning
But I can't see the ground
As I get closer

I need security for my sanity
I need love for my sanity
I need security for my sanity
I need love for my sanity
I need security for my sanity
I need security for my sanity

"Finding Your Way"

All you know and believe
About you
Everyone who's ever walked beside you
Will forever remember you.

All that you believed
Still they keep you in a place
By a shadow you still cannot see
Is now and will always be.

When you look in the mirror
You will recognize all the flaws
And flaws alone will fix them
A waste of time
A cost of pride
When pride is the answer
The tyrant's my den, I must be the one to lift them all out

When you're still trusting
Trusting too much will be a mistake
I'm the one to blame

I hear your cries
I hear your anger
I hear your frustration
I send the message
That everything is me too

You're holding back will be forgiven
But you're breaking down will be erased

When you're still trusting
Trusting
We know who we are
When you're still trusting
Always remember me?

When you're still trusting
Always remember me?

"Pale Blue Dot"

Under clouded skies
Dusk shuffle across the barren barren hills
The lonely trail to safety
Where shade and sense of "but"
Are absent

Some of us choose to believe
In the impossible
Others can't stand the thought of feeling alone

Through a veil of tears I come to understand

Some of us choose to believe
In the impossible
Others can't stand the thought of feeling alone

A burden that we all carry

Through a moment of confusion
We're inspired by a
