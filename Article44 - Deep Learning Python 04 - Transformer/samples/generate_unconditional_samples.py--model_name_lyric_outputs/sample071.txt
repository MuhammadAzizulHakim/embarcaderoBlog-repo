======================================== SAMPLE 71 ========================================
Department store, fine art, faded photographs adorns the wall. I could walk, I could write, I could play, I could dance, I could never lie.
I've been hiding under a summer day for many, many years
the memories of those oceans of tears still scramble my bones.
But I'm OK. Thank god I survived
and now I can't thank you enough. I didn't mean to lose sight.
X point in nine moves.
Work begins again.
Shes waiting, skin is new
and sirens, halos, down, up, up.
Give ear to me, I can't hear you
but I know you're crying.
I'm the one, the survivor. I can't hold on any longer.
Enough about your bullshit. Enough about your bullshit.

So don't listen. Don't wanna burn me.
Get a grip.
Down.
Get away.
Speak to me.

Planes come down.
Hear my voice.
Un-breathable
at will.

Sights remembered.
heard my voice.
Reached out in defense.
Copied from a book.
I'll defend myself.
Either win or lose.
The choice is yours to make.

My friends defies reason.
They believe in God and His will.
They believe in God and His will
and they believe in God and their will
And that's what they want me to be.

I want to be left alone.
Unaware as I'm of the danger,
I'm standing my own chance.
I want to be left alone.

Under the radar, you could tell me.
The blood flow is still poor.
Try as you might,
Engineering resistance won't help.
What you need is science.
You need that athleticism.
That's what I need.

I've been lying here all this time.
Numb
Frown out my eyes.
Un-conspiring all at the same time.

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence.
Darkness behind.
A silence that's like a stranger's disguise
ALL you saw face-to- face

Inside me sleeps a stranger.
An idol of sorts.
Shineshare in the sand, unearthly way.
One sound and whispers forevermore.
Spread out across a field of fire.
A road I've traveled on before.
So following familiar fire pathways
I'll share with you a tale.

My sleepy head is turning,
Where once I thought I knew you.
Sprawling out across the sun.

"Morning Glory"

Sun down. Sun down.

Linton Samuel Dawson
Stretching for miles
His smoldering fist needs a shot
I'm his childhood friend
Linton Samuel Dawson carries his pal
With him to their shattered dreams

And they can't escape from pain
These suffocating cold fingers touch and chill me
They lead me through the surefire path to stardom.

And they can't escape from pain
These suffocating cold fingers touch and chill me
They lead me through the surefire path to stardom

Born to rule and fear and wine
But always wanted to rule
Sitting in place
It all changed
The knocking at my door
Slams down the door
Procrastination paralyzing me

Yes, I can stone and skin
For all I know I'm just a girl
Heightening the odds

"Spring MCMLXXIV"

On a wind that is sailing strong
I can't help myself
I wish the music would turn into a song

On a tide that's rising strong
I can't help myself
I wish the music is turning into a movie

Hey hey hey hey
What do you think about humans
We're wired that way?
Don't try engaging with our own species

Scarcely 30 years remain
While we're at it
Can't everyone watch us down
(Imagined)

TV series and radio plays
All we need is the time

She never
