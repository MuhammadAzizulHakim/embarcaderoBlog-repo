"Fuck The Family Stone"

I was raised in a small midwestern town
By a loving father
By a loving mother

I grew up on a prodigiously;
Growing up on a junkie's stone
Holding his plumber's tools
And class struggle everyday
I'm the sort who can't laugh
I burned a hole inside to stay alive

I was thrust into the family stone
By a loving father
A loving mother

"Father's Lament"

[I. REFLECTION]

Every wretched dream
Is undone by morning
When the river runs dry

Every waking hour
Morning to dusk
Connection shut down
Heart sinking
And sinking further

Every wretched dream
Is undone by morning
When the river runs dry
When the river runs dry

And as I'm sunk
 deeper still
And deeper still
There's never a moment
Where I'm conscious of what is right

I'm pulled into the still
And turned into the blank
When all my dreams seem to lapse

Every wretched dream
Is undone by morning
When the river runs dry
When the river runs dry

And awake now
For the first time in a long time

[II. RESTORATION]

Run - past the first sign of trouble
Past the wreckage
Of moments of doubt and failure

Walk again
Nurtured by purity

And content with this empty shell of a life
Finds clarity in the slow drip of water
All the things that I've always done
And never lost

And now it's too late for you
To turn back home again

[III. TOOLS]

Every wretched dream
Is undone by morning
When the river runs dry
When the river runs dry

And wake up now
Don't be afraid of letting go
Today you are one of us
And you will be all alone if you keep going

And wake up now
Don't be afraid of letting go
Today you are one of us
And you will be all alone if you keep going

"Trial Of Tears"

[I. IT'S RAINING]

Under the sun, there is nothing to hide
Under the moon, RAINING

There is nothing sacred
And nothing worth waiting for
There is nothing beneath the pain
It's raining, raining,
Rain is already falling

Still no sign of life left
Under the cold light of the moon,
In the blind they stare,

Turning away,
Lost in the dark
And in the dark
They stare

It's raining, raining,
Rain is already falling

Still no sign of life left
Under the sun,
There is nothing to hide
Under the moon,
Rain makes the slow drip down

Still no sign of life left
Under the sun,
There is nothing to hide
Under the moon,
RING.

It's raining, raining,
Rain is already falling

Still no sign of life left
Under the sun,
There is nothing to hide
Under the moon,
RING.

"Invincible"

[I. Monster Mashup ]

When it's raining down
On the streets of New York City
Feeling like I'm stuck in a traffic circle
I throw more objects at the sky
Throws more stones
At people who I don't understand
Or just plain flies away

I can fly at will
And still be chased down the road
But my way will never be free

You can follow me down to the drop
But your way will never be free
Fly now, stay on the road

And your way will never be free

If you wanna stay alive in the dark
All this shit will have to wait...

I can fly, stay alive
But my way will never be free

If you wanna stay alive in the dark
All this shit will have to wait...

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
Why can't we drink forever?
I just want to start this over

My way is only as blind as you are brain

I'll get out of here
My way is only as blind as you are smart
I'll get out of here
My way is only as blind as you are dumb as me

You can follow me down to the drop
But your way is only as blind as me
If you wanna stay alive in the dark
All this shit will have to wait...

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
Why can't we have
