Don't miss the chance to shine
 luminous minds through the medium of cinema

Don't miss the chance to shine
Don't miss the chance to shine

Don't miss the chance to shine

"Only A Matter Of Time"

A mother talks to her son
He rubs his brown eyes
They don't respond well to
something simple like
a dose
They dip him in an ocean of sorrow

For 30 years
He has watched his world come to be
He have watched its happiness slip away

Only a matter of time
Until we are told
The uninvited man
suffering from mania
Only a fleeting glance will reveal his
heart

A bond is formed
But a message is received
The darkening skies make
for gentle passage
he takes his time
As the rain keeps falling
But a candle's a treat

A moment for thought
An answer for anticipation
A cry for change
A parting gift for theé»’ begins

As I whistle
The uninvited man
suffering from mania
Only a fleeting glance will reveal his
heart

"Watch In The Mist"

Watching the winding ascents
Like a horrid shift
I've grown tired of feeling the same
I feel the pull try to seize the day
But the day is never clearer

What would you say
If I simply walked away
Would I ascend?

Like a parlour
Hidden by signs of years of rain
An ancient rite still practised
Ascending to this crumbling temple
To cleanse her soul
Of her trials and tribulations

It's a matter of moments
Familiar voices stir
The air is rich with tradition
Yet all concern me

No matter how far
Past our currents
There is no turning back

I feel the earth shake
As I navigate the changing sands

I simply am not here
No way out
No answers, no begging
No one to call

Please don't stop at nothing
Empirization
The mystery is revealed
The trials and tribulations
Are revealed

Through the eyes of one man
The enigma slips away

And through the hunting for the golden boy
The enigma is claimed
And every time he disappoints
Resuming the routine
Every time he cracks the first speak

Often times when I drive by
The humor takes the place
And I'm left with a confused man

Your moment comes
When your destiny's gonna shine!!!

"Bonnie The Cat"

Can't feel the pain that I expected
I still place keys in the ignition
And pause the car to stare
At the horizon in which I now roam

Without warning
The music keeps on rising
The dancing keeps on turning

Waiting for new life
The surreal - who could have guessed
The possibilities are endless

Waiting for new life
The surreal - who could have guessed
The possibilities are endless

"Persephone"

The moon touches the sun
And brings the day back

I'm on my knees
Sleeping with my hands in the rain
Am I forgiven?
The tears are pouring down my face
I'm begging forgiveness from my soul destroyed

I'm on my knees
Sleeping with my hands in the rain
Am I forgiven?
The lies are spreading like cancer
I'm on my knees

"Anna Lee"

I'm on my knees
I'm on my own
With the children now
And the necrology wrong
If you want to get out, you've got to go
Home runs everywhere

And as always, I'm waiting
For someone new
This unfair system keeps me here

I'm getting nowhere
I'm getting nowhere
And nowhere leaves me
No choice but to seek

I'm getting nowhere
And nowhere leaves me
No choice but to seek

I'm getting nowhere
And nowhere leaves me
No choice but to seek

Anna Lee

I'm on my knees
I'm on my own
With the children now
And the necrology wrong
If you want
