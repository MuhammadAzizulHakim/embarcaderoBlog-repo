Bleak you
Seize the day
Break the ties
Daylight dims
Skin ripples in the moonlight
Rising and sinking
Like the first frost in a vast sea

And pride now bleeding for you
Like a summer moonrise
A cancer bedeopardess

"Pull Me Under"

Lost in the sky
Clouds roll in to cover
The angel of balance
The unbroken light
That hangs around misses you
The angel of balance
Tauntingly staring
At you in their golden state

You're in the dirt
In the sign of faith
The angel of balance
The unbroken light
That hangs around misses you
The angel of balance

Pull me under Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not leaving you alone
I'm trying to find my way,
Out of the wreckage
Of the chaos
Of the others
I'm the one who's to blame
When you're forcing yourself upon me
I'm the one who'll accept the blame

Pull me under Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not leaving you alone
I'm trying to find my way,
Of course I'm not alone in this
I'm falling,
But I can't climb higher

I can't face another day

As a child in the kingdom
Everyone was happy,
Now they say "oh"
When you pull me under

You're in the dirt
In the sign of faith
The angel of balance
The unbroken light
That hangs around misses you
The angel of balance
Tauntingly staring
At you in their golden state

You're in the dirt
In the sign of faith
The angel of balance
The unbroken light
That hangs around misses you
The angel of balance

Pull me under Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not leaving you alone
I'm trying to find my way,
Of course I'm not alone in this
I'm falling,
But I can't climb higher

I can't face another day

As a child in the kingdom
Everyone was happy,
Now they say "oh"
When you pull me under

"パズン"

A cornerstone was broken
And the moon appeared
And disappeared in the night
Pull me under
Pull me under
Oh dear

"人々

The Lotus Eater

The liquid is in my throat
I'm crippled beyond my wildest dreams
How can I let this bring me,
back to earth

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
The blood of departure
As the storm is drawing closer

I'm in the grounds below the waterline
And the only way to know it
Is WHEN THE FALL IS Nigh

I'm in the grounds below the waterline
And the storm is drawing closer

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
The blood of departure
As the storm is drawing closer

"The Amenity"

How can I feel abandoned when the world surrounds me
And the rumors that surround me
All stem from the moment I lay you down
I am struck dumb by the sound of falling water
And all the while by the memory of the night
When all I knew was wrong

I can remember thoughts sinking deep in
That came crashing down on me, trampling my silence
Things that I wouldn't want to hear,
My thoughts of you running away
Have left me in the dark

As I reached for the bottle
I could feel the walls breaking
As I reached for the fiver
I heard the giver's voice calling
While I was resting on the edge
I heard the story behind my eyes

It was the only thing that I could take
And it was all because I believed

It's been so long overdue
I turn my attention towards the future
And my heart cannot keep on getting older
As my body ages
I would sacrifice most of my treasures
But at this price I was too high
I promised I would never fall
But my soul can't keep on holding on
It's too late for me now
Too late for me now

"Untethered Angel"

You've built this world around you
Your universe
In spite of best intentions
Things could not be worse
Chaos and fear have left you
Hanging by a thread
As all of your thoughts and ideas
Have run aground
As all of your dreams are crumbling
You can feel the weight on your shoulders
As all of your dreams are
