======================================== SAMPLE 90 ========================================
But what if the Pioneers
Had gone astray?
What if they'd awakened Lazarus
And gone astray too

Lazarus smiles knowing
Lazarus smiles knowing

"Brother, Fearless"

[Sample is Jimi Hendrix's "Let It Be", from the release of his tape "Black".]

[irn]

For myself, as a youth,
Just as an adult,
If I could find you
Just ask 'ya

"Face In The Wind"

Take the case against
Seventy-six and a million
Look it right between the eyes
You can find the answers to all your big secrets
This is not freedom, this is heaven
Trust me, you can trust me

You can fly, but you must first rule the skies
Now here I am in the valley
Be still, till the sky falls forever
Spirit guide, guide, calm this vessel

"Do Or Desperate"

One sun will fall on this night
And all those years I have spent with you
Will disappear
She can never know you're there

One moon will fall on this night
And all those years I have spent with you
Will disappear
She can never know you're there

"Trains"

Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And my mind has been racing all night

Never a chance to wave goodbye
To distant docks and oceans

A dream that only weavers could keep
One idea comin' down
It's stopping me from getting home

In the dark a voice lives in your ear
And in the light a sneering hand is holding the switch
The stare of a stranger's disdain is a message

Like a cancer scare
Moments mistake for a heartbeat
It kills you to think someone can't fix your car
And in the morning a regret for a minute tells you everything

Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And my mind has been racing all night

"Lazarus Informer"

Confessor of Brennan's Ten (10)
In a row, all but one
Previously unknown to me

Lazarus in my head
 Gordie T, goofball, stole the show
Riding out the wave, claiming his silver bullet

Riding out the wave, claiming his silver bullet

On a railway track where the flicker lights cross
Every now and then a voice comforts
My son, drawing lines on the wall
A lullaby like a goodbye
It always seems to me

"Lepers coiled neath the snow
Draped on a black and gold parlour
And no trace of love heals this
Heart burning on a Kyng track

In the darkness a serpent spoke, naming his maker
Drained from his glories
And now they are withering away

Under the fog of winter's darkness sits a belief held by the sisters
A gleam of hope in her eyes
Shot in a dead eye by a fateful move

Between the scenes we move, waiting
For a bliss resembling a foreign land
Found a way into her heart

Behind the flowing water is a wall of doubt
A meaning for doom, a view from the dead

A cloudless night, resembling the scene from a dream
Flicker through the dabulous clouds
And less safe than it has been in a while

Between the scenes we move, waiting
For a bliss resembling a foreign land
Found a way into her heart

"H."

Nothing
I cannot tolerate you

After all we have done
There is no absolution
For you have become me

Nothing is left without redemption
For your sins and our confusion
There is no help you can look to

Nothing is left without redemption
For your sins and your confusion
There is no help you can look to

"Prison Sex"

It took so long to remember just what happened
I was so young and vestal then you know it hurt me
But I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise

I've got my hands bound
And my head down,
And my eyes closed
My throat's wide open

I do unto others what has been done to me
Do unto you unto all you've seen

I'm treading water
