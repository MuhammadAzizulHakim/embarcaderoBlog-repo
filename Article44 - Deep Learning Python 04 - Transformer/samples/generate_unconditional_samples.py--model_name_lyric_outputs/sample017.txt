Pioneer of our time
Faith and freedom
Old foes steal your dreams
But who's out of the game?

"Next of Kin"

Every morrow, every year
Choir of sounds
The final sorrow, so shed a tear

We are inside the voice of the universe
Discovering what makes us tick
And what life is all about

We are with you now, you are with us
Just a piece of meat in essence

Every morrow, every year
Choir of sounds
The final sorrow, so shed a tear

We are moving closer together
Though death still stumbles in my ear

Discovering what makes us tick
And what life is all about

We are sharing the same bed
And soul is wired the same way
Discovering what makes us tick
And what life is all about

We are moving closer together
Though death still stumbles in my ear
And soul is wired the same way

Every morrow, every year
Claspless ashes in my eyes
The moonlight ablaze
The crescent moon in my eyes

Every morrow, every year
Choir of sounds
The final sorrow, so shed a tear

"Again"

This feeling
Reminds me of going away
Something I was looking for

Never felt more at home

This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my home
It leaves a beautiful void

Finally found my home

"The Rest Will Flow"

In the moment I dwell
I drown in the river
Like a child who grows short of breath
And by the time I reach the water I've lost you

I'm saved through suffering
Underwhelming and beyond my wildest dreams

Floating on mist, refusing to turn back
She sings a lullaby to me
And I'm saved through suffering

"Blackest Eyes"

I lost all I had,
Came into this life to find
I'd never get out
And this death is not an option for me

See my shadow changing as well
As I see white sheets across the water

The mist is pouring down,
Whispering her lullaby
It's calling me back
That I am back

"Transcending Time"

Drifting in an instant by the phenomenon known as the Time Flicker
I am led astray
Into a vast and dark forest
The effects are real

Every year more than I realize
The pain is reaching far away
And it's endless surprise

"Last Chance To Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycled"

[a) Winding Shot (Summer 1981)]

At a time when the research agenda is still so enticing
and at a time when the loss of life is a real burden
for many
All of which could have been avoided

After all the tragedies so familiar
I look back with hope in my eyes
and at peace with regret at the end
I erase all the wrong done to me

All my dreams are shattered
And all my hopes are dashed
I'm left behind
In a land of blurred memories
I'm left behind

I had watched and thoughttered before
Now I'm the age of vogue
I belt out johnny tunes and kick ass on the track
All things considered, I must see it's just who I am
And I'm vilified as the man who failed to see the scar
I saved well but I turned to my friends and said
"Damn, I forgot to attach a scar."

Now that I've become aware
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent
I'm grateful for the courage I showed
In taking the time to word me
It's time for me to step down
as the man I am not

"The Rest Will Flow"

[INT. Gabriel's Hideout - Day]

[Faythe:]

Gabriel,
What are you doing?
Where do you belong?
Why are you running?
Where are you hiding?

I can help you in need
If only I could

But I can't heal your demons inside
You run the risk of absolving me of all guilt
