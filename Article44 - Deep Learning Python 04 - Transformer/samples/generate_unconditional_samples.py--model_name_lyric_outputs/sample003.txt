======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
But I love you for what you are
And I wish you well.

So many years have passed,
Through peaceful harvests
And cold war torn our thoughts.
Between our solitary shadows.
And as I rejoice in the creator
Of this fraud,
He is my god,
My God is my life."

Now that my heart is white and happy
I can rejoice in the fact that I could live without pain
When my soul has more peace of mind.

When I'm down I take the time to savour the moment
When I could rest and firm nerves
When I should start again.

I'm finding peace of mind when I'm down.

"When Your Soul Carries"

Into The Light Into The Light

Lifted from the darkness
Offers a tranquil haven
Shadows disappear
And away from the dark
.

When we shed the light
The movements are total
The darkness is gone
And calmness disappears

Into the light
By the way, my love
A thread fastened
On my skin
And by the way, I'm free

When we step into the light
The darkest dreams
Are haunting me
And I can't face them alone

When we're not together
We're much less than before

I'm finding peace of mind
When we step into the light
The movements are total
The darkness is gone
And calmness disappears

And away from the dark
.
When we shed the light
The movements are total
The darkness is gone
And calmness disappears

And away from the dark
.
When we step into the light
The movements are total
The darkness is gone
And calmness disappears

And away from the dark

"The Darkest Night"

A voice through the rain tells me something
Not all nights are like these
INT. Gabriel's Hideout - Night

[Arhys time
Turning into a thousand shadows
The crowd was silent as always
Gabriel was alone and silent
Show me the gold, the godfather was no more

Someone is waiting somewhere
Someone is waiting for me
Someone is waiting for the snake
Swallowed up the poison left in my blood

And now there I find my home
I found my home
It's not long from now but I'm so alone
It's so hard to fall
But I can't hold on any longer
Hold on to my secrets, they will be about to rain on my soul

Arhys time
Turning into a thousand shadows
The crowd was silent as always
Gabriel was alone and silent
Show me the gold, the godfather was no more

Someone is waiting somewhere
Someone is waiting for me
Someone is waiting for the snake
Swallowed up the poison left in my blood

And now they're stopping me from going anywhere
I can't remember when, but I'm so alone

I'm finding peace of mind
When the snake
slipped across my shoulder
I found my way back to my home
It's not long from now but I'm so alone
There's really nothing left for me to conquer

I'm hating everything
I'm hating the way things have come to be
I'm hating the way things have turned into a burden
I'm losing all hope I ever had
I'm losing my pride

[Arhys:]
I don't know why
I don't understand
Why so many years have passed
Since the day we met
And no-one has ever told me what a terrible surprise that has been

All my pain is one
And it's growing dark inside
All my love is one
I'm cutting the harness off of my heart
And I'm asking for no less than their undying love

[Daryus:]
Ginda tired of waiting
He's never had a good time
And no one's ever told him what a terrible surprise that has been

He's tired of hating everything
He's hating the way things have come to be
He's hating the way things have turned into a burden
He's losing all hope he ever had
He's losing my pride

"Right In Two"

Angels on the sideline
Riding out Lotus Chocolates
Sitting in Uncle Sam's car
It's raining...
Angels on the sideline
Riding out Lotus Chocolates
Sitting in Uncle Sam's car
Underneath the newsstand
Bar none
Pills and chloroform
All left behind

Half of my head hurts
One-half of my brain hurts

Half of
