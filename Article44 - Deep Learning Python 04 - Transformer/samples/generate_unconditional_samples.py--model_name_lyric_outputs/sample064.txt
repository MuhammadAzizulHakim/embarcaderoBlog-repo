Why can't we trust them?

"Feed my fear, kill my love"
[originally by the late Howard Portnoy]

"You are my ally
To liberate their children
And to end the longest and bloodiest war in American memory"...

"Mother Of Angels"

Mother of all Angels is the Mother of Angels
Fight her death with me She is my shadow as she neared the top

Our rituals, our secret warfare, must learn From Her
Fight the fear within me
I must inherit the victory
I am the first to admit
I am broken
My soul must inherit the fame
I am the first to admit
I am broken
My soul must inherit the victory

When I thought of the harvest of Christ
In joint submission to me
I felt the sting of rebellion
I knew the end was drawing near
Soon I wouldITE the axe of my enemies

"Viper King"

The moon shook and curled up like a gentle fire
With a touch of death upon her lips
I thought she had found the river
She had to know the beauty of the new day

She was with her child
When the lightning struck
The girl was carried away
And remember I will eat and die

"Dying"

We weren't there to rapture us
We were never-ending

Into the dying star
The final light
A silent sigh of relief

Once again we were
Not there to rapture us
We were never-ending

She would scream and somehow cover up
False repentance and false love
A catastrophic turning point

Endlessly circling
My soul was blinded by her light
Iwaiting only the few
The night would crumble
And loneliness would fade

Admitting error
Becoming the liar
 Of sin and salvation

Ignorant siblings
Dragging one another down
Spinning the tale
Until everyone is the same

My spirit would thrill and snore
Saying words of wisdom
Asking questions
Searching out mysteries

Why Iliction
A remedy
Justifying violence
Perturbed mind
Ruling other's lives

Perturbed mind
Dying
A desperate pursuit
Of happiness
III the end of the world

"Beneath The Darkness"

forums
Obsession
Petrified
Endless drain
Cause my words are lost
Soul rejected

Enormously lonely
Endless misery
The strain on my heart

[Spoken words:]
"Everything is fate"
"You have to live before you realize that life is not that simple"
"If you accept premonitions, then everything will be alright"
"I told you the story of my life so you can see it from a different perspective"
"I'll keep it down again soon enough"

Our hearts are racing
We're kicking and screaming
He said I'm tearin' 'em up
Close your eyes and tell me what you see is not fate"

We're in the wreckage
Of our primal state
Destined to become
Reactive and introverted
Reactive and introverted
Reactive and introverted
Reactive and introverted

"Straight Out"

It took so long for me to connect
With my soul

I lost all I had (that April day),
Then my spirit flew into the wrong body
And traveled to another

I was so far away
So far from home
I lost my way
To save myself
From myself

This was a long way from making it to this moment
I've got this conflict up in the road
I need to know that somehow
I'll be there for you
To find me and save me

This was so long for me to make it this way
But I can't take another day

I feel like I'm stuck
Talking to you about my life
And it's only getting worse

I can't take another day

I feel like I'm stuck
Talking to you about my life
And it's only getting worse

I can't take another day

I feel like I'm stuck
Talking to you about my life
And it's only getting worse

I can't take another day

I feel like I'm stuck
Talking to you about your life
And it's only getting worse

I can't take another day

I feel like I'm stuck
Talking to you about your life
And it's only getting worse

I can't take another day

I feel like I
