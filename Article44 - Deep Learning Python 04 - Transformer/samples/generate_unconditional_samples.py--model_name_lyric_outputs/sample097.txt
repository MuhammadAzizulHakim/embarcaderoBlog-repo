And now I'm stuck with the past

I want everything to be alright
I even tried playing God now
Told me how my life would start from here
And now I'm stuck with the past

Did I fail to mention my honest intentions?
Or was it all just another tragedy?

Whatever the reason, I can't escape from this conclusion
Heed my words justice will be done

"The Brew"

At this historic New Year's party we invite the drinker
With a good hallelujah
To sing or dance with him

At times the lights go down
And the lights go down

We make our way as slow as we can
But it's another day

And as a show of strength
We blend in
As a band we're a fire
And lightning fast

When we're down
We can laugh about it
But when we're up
We can wave it goodbye

We can dance to it
But when we're down
We can dream it back

And as a symbol of pure freedom
We rage, glory, rage
At times the music is harnessed
And the violence is physical

We're left with nothing but ashes inside
But as a symbol of pure freedom
We rage, glory, glory, rage
At times the music is harnessed
And the violence is physical

"Serenity Ties"

[INT. Bohemian Grove - Day]

[Strider:]
If I thrust my right hand into his brook
He will sink or swim
Or look sick in the eye

And if I gaze into the dark
I see friendships dissolve
And blood ties disappear

Into the fog of death
Another man dies
Into the fog of death

Somewhere like a bad dream
I allow the shadows to cover me
In the light of day
Though never aware of the looming danger

Scattered whispers in the crowd
Are the whispers from the burning shrine?
A million words stolen from me

I'm taken away from myself
Bring this pain and hatred
To the surface now
Like the ghost of a lost child
She talks about her love for you
And how much she missed you

I'm greeted by a crowd full of merrymakers
And the echo of a dying friendship
Sits at the birth of a follower
Between the weeping man and the bereaved

"Like A Virgin"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Faythe:]

It was an April morning
When she greeted me with a familiar greeting
Like receiving a cousin
Of late times when I've wished him nothing
But now she's forgotten you're here
And there's a chill in the air
I'm afraid to tread on his legacy

Like a wound raised in a park
An early morn, a story told
Still mother sings to him
Like you've come home

[Arabelle:]

You tread on my life dearly
And here I am waiting
For a chance to meet you today
And you're looking away

[Daryus:]

Don't shut up about me
I'm not afraid
I'll always love you
And when you're around me and I'll shine
You'll shine...

Like a flower smashed to pieces
By a relative
That made you cry
While giving you her soft touch

"Even Less"

A body is washed up on a Norfolk beach
He was a friend that I could not reach
He thought I was cold but I understand
But for the grace of god goes another man

And I may just waste away from doing nothing
But I'm a martyr for even less

A choir boy is buried on the moors
Where we used to go dreaming when we were bored
Some kids are best left to fend for themselves
And others were born to stack shelves

And I may just waste away from doing nothing
But I'm a martyr for even less

Fuck you and your book too
You can have it back
When I'm gone these songs will
Will be my tracts

And I had a stupid dream that I could change things
But I'm a martyr for even less

I hate the ground that I have walked upon
Nothing I've done has ever mattered long
