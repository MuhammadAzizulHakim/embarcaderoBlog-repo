I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking
And wanna feel your body breaking
I wanna feel your body breaking
Right behind your back

"Cold And Ugly"

“Throw that Bob Marley wanna-be motherfucker outta here
“Throw that Confederate general out of there

Fuckin' war, I wanna be a leader
I wanna live up like a fucking American
And I wanna live like a fucking American
And I wanna Live Up Like aKingfisher

I want to be loved and I wanna live up like aKingfisher

I've got a feeling that I'll never want another
And I wanted to be loved for who I am
And I've got a feeling that I'll never want another

This shit is cold and ugly, and I can't wait to get into it
This shit is cold and ugly, and I can't wait to get into it

My mistake, and your too

" All About Lisa "

When Lisa Vander Pelt was just a boy
Everything seemed free of cost
I laughed with laughter as she walked away

I sing her memory
When she cries
It's because she's afraid
That I can keep from losing you
That I can keep you from
lying down

Nothing ever felt more unconditional
And all my dreams
Remain dreams that we both can

And we'll never ask you if you're ever going back

Nothing ever felt more unconditional
And all my dreams
Remain dreams that we both can

And we'll never ask you if you're ever going back

" Finally "
The song changes everything
And finally brings back Summer

I know what's left behind
Is what I thought it would be
Leave behind what was left

In the distance, unmade memories run
As I race to find the last sign
Of what might have been a forever

Here are some of my thoughts
Coincidence, I can't tell
But I feel like I'm racing to the final sound
To free myself from what's left behind

Something went wrong. Please try again
I can't remember what happened
Standing in the darkness, glaring at the unknown

There's a certain quality that I find shocking
It doesn't surprise me that someone of my ability
Has such a bright future ahead

(Heed these lyrics lyrics with his own thoughts)

"All my natural instincts
Are begging me to stay
But somehow
I'm turning away
What've I done?
I've forgotten what they came for

Signals in theised meadow
Midnight hour
Wherever there is sleep
There's nowhere to go
Until the tempest will linger in the conifer

Signals in theise
Midnight hour
Wherever there is faith
There's nowhere to go
Until the tempest will linger in the conifer

Signals in theise
Midnight hour
Wherever there is faith
There's nowhere to go
Until the tempest will linger in the conifer

Signals in theise
Midnight hour
Wherever there is faith
There's somewhere to go
Until the tempest will linger in the conifer

Are we paying attention?
Or are we lulled into a false sense of security

Signals in theise
Midnight hour
Wherever there is faith
There's anywhere to go
Until the tempest will linger in the conifer

Signals in theise
Midnight hour
Wherever there is faith
There's anywhere to go
Until the tempest will linger in the conifer

Signals in theise
Midnight hour
Wherever there is faith
There's anywhere to go
Until the tempest will linger in the conifer

Somehow I survive
Because I know what I'm done
With what I'm learned this past week
Will guarantee a better life

The tempest will linger in the conifer
