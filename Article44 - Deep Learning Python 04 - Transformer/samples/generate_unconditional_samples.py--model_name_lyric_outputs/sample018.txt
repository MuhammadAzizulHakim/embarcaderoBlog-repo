======================================== SAMPLE 18 ========================================
Out of spite, out of spite
I took the streets
My home that I left behind
And traveled all the way to Los Angeles
To meet the man who I thought I would become

Lost I saw the future
And moved with the day
I met the new man
Out of spite, out of spite
I caught the train
It took me all the way to the valley
Where the mist has disappeared
And brought me back to reality

My train pulls into the tracks
And pass the site of my fateful night
And no-one will know
The ultimate test

I try to forget you
Or find you
With regret, in the blink of an eye

"Hex Omega"

Three thousand dreams
Counting...

The scratching of my ear
The rustling of my shoes
The thudding of my footsteps
Singing my own praise

Three hundred and one
One rejoicing
A sadness registration
I lose myself to the automated
Dance of millions
The knocking of my footsteps
On the ancient hand
Of the modern ear

Twixt the stars
One and three
Nations begin to trace my
Am I not the man who I was meant to be?

I have always believed
In the greatest of all
Asung a position unknown
And now until that moment
I am whole

And more than once
I've believed
In the one who paved the way
For us to meet

Another day
And distance unseen
And life from this moment
Beyond the sun

Twixt the stars
One and three
Nations begin to trace my
Am I not the man who I was meant to be?

I have always believed
In the greatest of all
Asung a position unknown
And now until that moment
I am whole

And more than once
I've believed
In the one who paved the way
For us to meet

"The Enemy Inside"

Running blood, hiding memories
Pain is a risk
But at least I survived
Torn in two
The memory has run dry

The enemy inside
Inside the nightmare
He lives his life alone
He's a monster inside and won't let up
He's been caught in his schemes

He lives his life but knows no-one knows his weakness
He's a drifter living in the wilderness
Wherever he can find you, he'll drop you
Until the price he pays
Relieve me
From a state of catatonic sleep

I am trapped inside this monster
There is nothing I can do
But I'm stronger than he is

"Patterns In The Ivy 2"

I got the feeling that time would climb
And I got the feeling that death
Will never take me away
So I cancelled out the good times
And took a vacation from "dreaming"
Through the years.

The music gave me clues
I heard his voice through the window while I was sleeping
And I've been searching for the words to write my new life
A new adventure
That will open my eyes and erase all my lies

The music gave me clues
I heard his voice through the glass while I was sleeping
And I've been searching for the words to write my new life
A new adventure
That will open my eyes and erase all my lies

"The Rover / Achilles Last Stand"

[I. The Rover]

It was a dark and lonely Sunday morning
The mist was sleeping on the sea
The chill of a winter's night
I was searching for a tone
To light a fire, words lost
With the help of my senses
I drove a stolen car
Tumbling through the countryside
A lonely man on a railway track
Was this the end

It was a cold, windless April day
The railway ties I've tied to my life
Were just a memory
I hold in the hope that he'll leave me
As IComeToSelf

I lost all ambition and ambition
Kept everything a secret
I'm slipping back into my shell
As my years move along

I was far too attached
To start with
Without the help of my senses
I'm sinking like a stone

After all the fun and games
What went wrong?
And where did I go wrong?
Helpless laughter and incoherent stares
Are the memory wounds of a childhood memory

I fell in love
