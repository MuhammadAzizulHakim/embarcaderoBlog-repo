"Behind The Veil"

Hidden by creed
hidden by blood

Until we light a fire
There is darkness beneath
The words we speak is eternal night
The crescent moon rises high
But the day is late

Honesty in the necrology
The offspring smear your name
Genetic code

[swearing notes]
There is no such thing
As pure fate
written in stone

You tempt me with your enticing advice
A test of faith
In the form of blood
Before you judge or praise

There is no right or wrong
Feeling strangers on my side

[They march forth]
Amid the blackness
They are stalked by night
Through a veil of madness
That somehow I am sane
Though I am an Andorian

[The pharaohs]
Have you seen or heard of the Dead Sea Cruise?
Offering endless hours on the phone
With no apparent reason
Asingenic regrets
A waste of time

Standing in the light
I could never see the message
As I wallow in my own self-righteous ways

[The pilot:]
Just let me taste his blood
Before I judge or glory
I must judge or glory
I cannot glory in myself
I am in the sea of hurt

"When Your Time Has Come"

[EXT. Ravenskill Amphitheater - Night]

[Narrator:]
She can't forget...
The night she's mostdreams
When night becomes day

A father, a mother
Her son and a guide
Come Julian with them
To find out what's been...
Lost Keys, Baldur's Gate

[Faythe:]
I thought you could Dance Heal me...
Or Fight Monsters, but nothing like what you get
With this in your bag...
Your precious experience

I tried the hero's run
But I've got a pit in my legs
And I can't hold on any longer

[Magenta skybox:]
Nothing like what I get

[Daryus:]
You're welcome...

[Faythe:]
Yeah I'm stoked to see you again

[Daryus:]
Just let me taste his blood
Before I judge or glory
I must judge or glory
I cannot glory in myself
I am in the sea of hurt

"Never Enough"

[EXT. Ravenskill Amphitheater - Night]

[Narrator:]
She can't remember what she said
But she can't forget
How she kept her mouth shut
And shut down all her friends
To forget about what she had said
Never enough

[Gabriel:]
You're never enough
I'm never enough

[Arhys:]
You're never enough
what's left
is all you get

[Den of Tolerance, Insane and Wanton]

I'll never enough
forgive you
I'll never enough
forget you
Nothing you feel

And tolerate you
Now we're dead and ghost
We can't carry on
as long as you keep getting
As far as you can go
And hopefully you'll leave me here alone
It's just not worth it

I'll never enough
I'll never enough
I'll never enough
I'll never enough

"My Ashes"

[INT. Ravenskill Ampitheater - Night]

[Gabriel:]
Justified in my blood
A sacrifice I long for
inocence
Had we stayed connected
would this not been unearthing
truth for the first time

In the blink of an eye
The astral body stares back at you

After all the time has passed
It stills mourns for you
And dismisses you as a hopeless liar

[Arhys:]
You think you're so cool?
That smile you shed for me
was etched upon my skin
I wonder if this friendship will last
As all of your dreams are gone

"Benighted"

[INT. Ravenskill Ampitheater - Night]

[Benighted]
When your appetite for flesh and blood falters
wartime contact with the light
of the dark can't lure you away

You're a foolish child
You're a Grimm
born to rule and guide me

You have nothing against me
though I'm afraid to be free
Of what I see
and the words you use
I can't keep forever
But I'll give them my way
When liberty's worth the fight

[Gabriel:]
You behaved just as you'd
