======================================== SAMPLE 45 ========================================
Thought I would leave tonight
All my woes behind
Clean blood drain my soul
Cause tonight I am standing above all

[Solo: Ã…kerfeldt]

I will remain inside this place
Begging God to please stop the violence
Until there is no more pain
There is no salvation for our sins
sins we have hated
We are turning away

"Wither"

What is left
When we cry
When the anger consumes
And all our fears are washed away

Misgiving and dismay
A true believer knows
That faith is a death-payoff
That anyone can survive
For if we are baptized
Then all our fears are washed away

In the stream of consciousness
I hear voices you've never heard
And I've never seen you move so suddenly

It's become clear to me
Though I am surrounded
I can see with relative clarity
The snake in the corner
And his stigma still haunts me

What is left
When we cry
When the anger consumes
And all our fears are washed away

Misgiving and dismay
A true believer knows
That faith is a death-payoff
That anyone can survive
For if we are baptized
Then all our fears are washed away

"The Ivy Leagues"
[I. REFLECTION]
So far have I seen Ivy Leagues
Prodigies, brothels, and poor love interest

Lepers coiled neath the trees
Dying men in bewildered soliloquies
Perversions bloom round the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic under the weeping trees

The Ivy Leagues
Are upon us

Heroes die each year at ground zero
The quest for humanity's salvation
Spins out before our eyes

Young and old, helpless souls fed famine
Every so often a voice is heard
The crowd has its way
A thirst for revenge
Caught in unbridled suspense

Inie rails, man, smashing ground
He is the voice of reason
Hitler to his death

[II. RESTORATION]

Under glass ceiling
Inie draws pictures
Vibrant as ever
His dislocated virgin
Is freed from her prison cell
A radiant blur surrounded by death

Lepers coiled mournfully on the wood
Dying men in bewildering soliloquies
Perversions bloom round the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic under the weeping trees

The Ivy Leagues
Are upon us

Heroes die each year at ground zero
The quest for humanity's salvation
Spins out before our eyes

"Bleak"

Beating
Heart broken
Overwhelming
My spirit's not so strong
I cannot fend it
Tired bones decay
Empty lungs die

Infecting
Pest increase
Mold en masse
Feeding
Graceless
Devastating
Health miracle

His hand is mine
He will find it
His body is mine
Shards of soil and water below
Bleeding him in the process

My breath is clubbing the fever
There is no help now
He cannot escape
His eyes are falling shut
His body is his problems
Reaching for his life
There is only me
I must reach for the life I could find

"Beneath The Surface"

Is there ever really was a right time?
You had led me to believe
Someday you'd be there for me
When the stars above aligned
When you weren't so consumed
I kept looking for the clues
So I waited in the shadows of my heart
And still the time was never right

Until one day I stopped caring
And began to forget why I longed to be so close
And I disappeared into the darkness
And the darkness turned to pain
And never went away
Until all that remained was buried, deep beneath the surface

A shell of what things could've been
Tired bones beneath a veil of guarded secrets all too frail
Sad to think I never knew
You were searching for the words to change my life
Yet the moment I chose to live is still standing
So glad I found you
Not only with my heart but with all my soul
Sorrow in me too

"Patterns In The Ivy"

I,

Never stop the car on a drive in the dark
When the music fades away
And the girl is home alone
Why do I always feel frightened of her?

I,
