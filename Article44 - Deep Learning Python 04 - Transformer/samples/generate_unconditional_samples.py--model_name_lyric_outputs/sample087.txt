======================================== SAMPLE 87 ========================================
The sun is burning bright
And my clothes are dusty
My razor's edge crooked
In the light of dawn
She stares into the sun

"By The Pain I See In Others"

Let me taste
Let me feel
Let me breathe
Let me admire
Let me breathe

If I would, could you?

It's simply not possible
For every soul affected
It saddens me to know
Those tears I lost
For the anguish they carry

"Illumination Theory"

[I. Paradoxe de la Lumière Noire]

[Instrumental]

[II. Live, Die, Kill]

Consider this question
Look deep inside
Deliver a true confession
What are you willing to live for?

Consider this question
Open your eyes
Examine your own reflection
What are you willing to die for?

When your backs’ against the wall
And the time's uncertain
Consider this question
No standing by
When flesh and blood are threatened
What are you willing to kill for?

We've all lost our way this week
When faith and freedom seem threatened

We know what will be
When temptation plays a role

And the end is drawing closer
When life begins to feel like a sacrifice
We know what will be

And the end is drawing closer
When life begins to feel like a sacrifice

"The Patient"

A vein starts to close
A few drops in the dosage
A history of what might have been
A warning not to judge

There's a steady stream of familiar faces
Scratching at the seams
Everyone knows what might have been

Vacant memories
Running headlong at the same time
Everyone knows what may have been

A heart that feels no pain
 TBTF every day
 I'm nursing the disease
 It's vicious until it kills me

Someone told me once
You can't blame your own parents
For abandoning you.

Vacant memories
Running headlong at the same time
Everyone knows what might have been

Someone told me once
You can't blame your own parents
For abandoning you.

Vacant memories
Running headlong at the same time
Every soul exposed
To a vengeance
Pushed to the limit

"Outside"

The light comes on
The traffic light is gone

The chill of winter's darkness sits still
Trying to break through

The chill of winter's darkness sits still
Trying to break through

Outside this winter's darkness
Nocturn
She said her name outside of winter's darkness

Outside this winter's darkness
Nocturn
When there's a danger of her saying it
There's no turning it back

<|endoftext|>

"Falling Through"

We made it through the winter
Not enough to keep us occupied
And there's nothing we can do

There's something that I'd like to know
Before you leave your home
Come and find me
There's something you'd like to see
Before you leave your home
It's perfectly clear
Just where I come from
How I feel about lying

Still never returning
To this moment
To find the strength to carry on
I bare all that I am
Wearing my honor down
On this moment of my doubt

Still never returning
To this moment
To find the strength to carry on
I bare all that I am
Wearing my honor down
On this moment of my doubt

"The Looking Glass"

I would not expect you felt unnoticed and ignored
Better to rise above the clouds Then be a stranger in the crowd
All that you protected doesn’t matter anymore
Rather be stripped of all your pride
Than watch your dreams be cast aside

You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying stardom
Serenity politics
 garnish the term "settle"

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You are not content with being nameless and unknown
Trying to rise above the fray
Eager to give it all away

Some will not admit that 15 long years have made them
Some will not admit that they’ve been waiting all this time

There is something that I want to say
And that I hope you will say
It's true
Just where I come from
How I feel about lying
