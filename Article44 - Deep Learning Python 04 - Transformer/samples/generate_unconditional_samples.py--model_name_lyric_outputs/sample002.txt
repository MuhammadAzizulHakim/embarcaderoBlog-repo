======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
A passionate believer
I believe change is possible
and that faith is a lifelong waiver
It helps when you refuse to change
and silence has no place
In this bleak and unforgiving land

Thank you for the inspiration
Thank you for the guidance
Through our many encounters
Recognize this as a monumental step in our live
Recognize this as a monumental step in our live

[III. Full Circle]

Open wounds hidden under the skin
Feed their souls to darkness
Awaiting remedy dawning
No more begging for mercy
This lamentable deed is your fate

They are passing souls through the rain
Useless silhouettes tossed about
While distrust and hate remain
In your recesses, snuffing the signal
Awaiting the Day
As the stream of life winds down
And the grave digests its sorrows

Empty and torn, each day renews
As the days go by
And the days go by

Empty and torn, each day renews
As the days go by
And the days go by

"Patterns In The Ivy 2"

Without you I cannot confide in anything
The hope in your hearts is pale designed in light of dreams you bring
Summer's gone, the day is done soon comes the night
Biding time, leaving behind the past, so it came to be
With you I will keep your dreams alive
I'll elevate to take the crown
To glory, standing above the fray
style and strength, smart and bold
sets fine, letting you choose
As you choose, lead the way
As you choose, lead the way
Through the doors of our shared dream
So you can look up to me
Take the place of savior
Through the eyes of this enemy to be

"Light In The Hand"

We sit by the fire while night descends
And on the day that you prayed
While we were sleeping
The sight of your face in the window
Overture of a sorrow season
Poisoning the well for us both

Without you, we cannot breathe
Without you, we cannot die
Without you, we can't

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

Sacrifice my life
Neglect my kids and wife
All for you to be happy
All those sleepless nights
And countless fights to give you more
And then you say how dare that
I didn't write you back
I only say I love you
Because I love you so much

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

"You Not Me"

You may have noticed, but none seem to know you
This is a parody of your real life
And you get all your hate speech from your Twitter
This is your stand alone foul play
No matter what you decide
It's only a matter of time

You're still alone
This is the human cost
Not all sins can be forgiven
And there may be other forgiven
With deep sins beneath, there's no turning back

You're losing yourself
This is the cost of sin
Not all sins can be forgiven
And there may be other forgiven
With deep sins beneath, there's no turning back

You're losing yourself
This is the human cost
Not all sins can be forgiven
And there may be other forgiven
With deep sins beneath, there's no turning back

"Burden"

We're sitting here alone
No one is talking to him
He can't see us here
But he knows who we are
And he's trying to get us out
Here, here, here
It won't be long, not soon

Will he call me when this boredom wears me out?

Here we sit alone
In this house
With the cupboards and the closets
We weren't too far away

When the breeze blew through this fog and we were underground
We called upon the enigmatic
To guide us under
And silence their cries, silence would shatter the haze
So we went
