======================================== SAMPLE 76 ========================================
and all I had with me
was stolen
from my close friend
His shadow would linger on my cold blue
glass
and black
ship would disappear as well

It was the most terrible thing
I've never seen
I've never wanted to return, I'm so alone
I can't remember what the feeling was
And I can't remember why I
Had such a terrible dream
But it never became a burden
It's so hard to get through

"As I Am"

Always something to remember
Being with my own soul
I never seem to get away
From our cold metamorphosis

And in between hits the paced and violent
That I cannot remember happiness
As I am running from this
I am crossing over

Running headlong at the ground
Just stopping to rest
On my own skin

Somebody has to be the one to know
It's better to be lost
And many times I've lost everyone I'm caring for

Someone to see and understand
This loss makes me feel better

Running headlong at the ground
Just stopping to rest
On my own skin

"Blackest Eyes"

I have often told you stories
About the way
I spent my days
Underneath the stairs
Finding the time
When every light takes her
Withdrawn blood
And flaunting her already fading health

Still I labored under the strain
ToPF
Turn on the light
And watch the shutters go
Stuck to her every move

Every time I turn my head
There's another face
Behind me

There was a sickness
In that moment I forgot
My own name
They were the first words I heard

smiling face, voice and body
With a goodbye that's long too
(I'm running out of time)

"Blood On The Wind"

It was April
Sipped with the cold bitter cold
By a sister aswan
And every morning when she woke me
Could she have told me of all the times
I've lost all I've had
And she would have told me of all the ways
You're laying in wait for me

I'm in the drizzle
And her hand is waiting

It was a stupid idea
But she can't understand
If love is for me
Or if it's fate
I'm in the lake
Or in the park
Or in the chapel
It's up to you to judge

She's in the morning and I just cutting the grass
But she'll disappear into the cool air

Like a scream but no more real
A woman is taken for a ride
And her father is too
Forget it.
Rehearsal of one's dear one
Without a doubt

My moment in the sun
My moment in the rain
My moment in the dark
My moment in the dark

"Always Never"

It was September
And I was sweating, and my head was full of lead
The canvas on which I hung my new career

I hated the way the morning went
With sweat plastered all over my eyes
And my faith in brown devils
I practically begged my soul to be my own

I'm in the store to buy shoes
I'm in the store to buy tapes
I'm in the store to buy books
I'm in the store to buy a new car

I'm cutting the grass
But I can't forget April
Her sweet touch still greased my shoes
I'm in the store to buy a new guitar
I'm in the store to buy a new coat
I'm in the store to buy a new house

I'm in the store to buy a new watch
I'm in the store to buy a new record
I'm in the store to buy a new car

I'm in the store to buy a new friend
I'm in the store to buy a new controller
I'm in the store to buy a new necklace
I'm in the store to buy a new watch
I'm in the store to buy a new house

"Black Dahlia"

The first thing that I saw as,
the mother of all,
was,
was Mary Hadfield.

The extra pounds that she had on her.
She was:
A) blind,
B) not a word,
C) coming home tonight.

And when I tell her how proud she is of her
bears,
She answers,
"yes I am."
And says that she would never hurt anyone.

So, she brings home a giant brand new breed
