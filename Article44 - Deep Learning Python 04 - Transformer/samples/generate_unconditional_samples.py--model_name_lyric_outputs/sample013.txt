And knife her to pieces before our eyes
And every time I turn away
I am at a loss for words

I have always felt alone
Out of reach
Some fall to free me
Others leave me
As all hope is lost

[V. The Reckoning ]
Taking aim
Plunging into the deepest void
Defying all reason
Defying darkness

I can cope
I can't stop
My demons are pouring forth
They seek to take me back

"In My Time Of Need"

I can't keep away from its clutch
Tearing fabrics from my soul
I cadet at the academies
Watching through the windows
I never felt more alone
I'm sick of constant prying eyes
Taunting your silence with eyes of catatonic shame

Out of nowhere, a churning black vessel
Seeking to subdue
My fragile psyche tossed into the water

anicemies in flames
spread across the sun
mystical beasts fight
to bring me back

"Search And Destroy"

Core Set

White Walls, moorings crunched
Tile after giant
Tardis ticking
Computers buzzing
Trapped in regressions
Locked in time
To find what it's cracked to love

In the blink of an eye, the latch on the door
Hiding behind a wall of nothing
Tearing flesh from bone

Search and destroy
Pushing doors with mettle
Boredom's not the same as thrice
Wired in heels
Destroying innocence

Stars bend higher than rest
Eyes open wide
Heads bring rapture
Tears wash clean

Signals overload
Collapse the silence
Barren lands in grief

Signals reach higher still
Throat of Summer
Light take hold
Gather dots on the ground
Searching for a way out

Northern designates times
2000 GMT,

"The Scratching Of Leaves"

Remembered tragedy
Addicted to its soil
 Leaves smoldering

Carelessly in love with flowers
Growing closer to them all

Seperates in the wake of heat
A cancer bedraggled
Sun burns bright
Voices grow in the dark

Chemical wealth thrives
Consumed in debates
Waging a war inside
One man's war

Until peaceful co-existence
Empires 21st century
Time is of the essence

Chemical wealth thrives
Consumed in debates
Waging a war inside
One man's war

Examine familiar motions
Receiving and preserving
The truth of it all

Finding truth in what we have seen
Finding truth in what we have heard
Finding truth in what we have seen

Nothing is stronger than faith
Life goes on forever
And where there is faith there lies the future

På flekte Kändiga
Endlessly waiting

She is lost and alone
She knows that she is stuck
She rides on the shoulders of giants
She knows no one is left
She is a burden for her to bear
She is a bullet for her to see

She is a burden for her to see
She is a bullet for her to breathe

She is fearless and perfect
She will never let her memories of pain come back
She knows herself into the world
And the world is waiting

"Hope Lied"

In the hope of our souls
And those of us who have stayed
And those of us who cannot escape,
Haven't mattered much when hope was newness
Hope was always newness
And at last, after many disappointments

Hope found a new home in usurer's embrace
Hoping that our final touch would be a voice
That we might as well turn our backs on those we hate

Hope found a new home in usurer's embrace
Hoping that our final touch would be a voice
That we might as well turn our backs on those we hate

Hope found a new home in usurer's embrace
Hoping that our final
