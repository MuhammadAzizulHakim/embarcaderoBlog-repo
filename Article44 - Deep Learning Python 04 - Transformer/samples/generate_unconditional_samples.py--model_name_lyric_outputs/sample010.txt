of souls born within this nightmare
The end of an era

Her embrace
A mirror stepped on her face
This act of love has brought us here
Now we can begin to piece together her memory
This experience will give us all her strength
She must learn to live with her loss
She is in her own world
She is connected to all things dark and fast
Through the eyes of one man

Closure to feel
Always present when I feel most alone
Wake up strong with love in me

Hate letter "Bored Of You"
Falling down love stalk
Seeking escape from the past
This thread of light must be pulled to light
The darkened oaken finds me alone
It takes the darkness out on me

She does not understand
Her obsession
Wake up, remember
This feeling
Must be hellish
Forfeit all control
She is searching for a cure
She is just searching for

Angels fall just like moonsar
Falling down with love in me

Love at any cost
It's all in the light
Of mercy and humanity
Hope drowns the pain
All that's left is bitterness and hate
Just another day

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their saviour's calling
In the light of our new world

[III. REVELATION]

Way off in the distance I saw an iron cage
I turned with caution
Nearing the other side
The grinning mouth of the madman
Our lone victim

Iron cage, magnificently displayed
I saw from the other side
A wicked man wearing a mask
Magenta hair swayed in wonder
Just when I thought I thought I could see
A long lost friend
Shall we claim him lord of all

"Abominable Snow"

Black procession through the narrow aisles
All the more reason to fear
No wonder the snow's so hard to find

No wonder the snow's so hard to find
No savior we should wish to see

Standing in the way is a beast within the snow
That once was a man
Now we can only pray for his swift demise

For we know the truth of this matter
Standing as the victim is a god within the snow
That would well framed
In the aura of the day

Judgement day looming
With both eyes upon the prize
Sitting in the darkness I was possessed
By the black procession

Even as I march through the streets
With the dead in mind I am reached with the sounds
Of distant trains making their way
Lonesome days drawing near

Still no savior we must pray for's brave demise
No savior we must pray for's swift demise

White days determined
With the cold season move into winter
Once the only shelter
Of my abode

Still no cure for the madness
That road is long gone
Travelling far too slowly
Along the way
It's saying a thousand words I don't understand

"Still Day Beneath The Sun"

There is a light that hits the gloom around
Shows the footprints round this grave
Dried up roses scattered on the ground
Honouring the one engraved

Will ever the morning
Carry away
The souls of those for whom we cry

Leaving, grieving
Seeking, meeting
Binding, unwinding
Sighing, "you"

Still day beneath the sun
Asking you who is the one
And those for whom we cry

And when will we reap the rewards
Of our deeds?

Too much for them all
To see all upon which we build
Too many a leaf for we to cross

Leaving, grieving
Seeking, meeting
Binding, unwinding
Sighing, "you"

Still day beneath the sun
Asking you who is the one
And those for whom we cry

Leaving, grieving
Seeking, meeting
Binding, unwinding
Sighing, "you"

Still day beneath the sun
Asking you who is the one
And those for whom we cry

Leaving, grieving
Seeking, meeting
Binding, unwinding
Sighing
"you"

"Patterns In The Ivy 2"

Without you I cannot confide in anything
The hope is pale designed in light of dreams you bring
Summer's gone, the day is done soon comes the night
Biding time, leaving the line and out of sight

Without you I cannot confide in anything
The hope is pale designed in light of dreams you bring
Summer's gone, the day is done soon comes the night
