======================================== SAMPLE 55 ========================================
Maybe I'm just an old soul
Maybe I'm just an old soul

I'm finding courage in my darkest hour
I'm calling out a name
When praise is the only answer
There is no betrayal here
I'm innocent as the gullible
There's no salvation for this test
I'm testing myself against the best

"Message to Harry Mansell"

Figlio di puttana, sai che tu sei un pezzo di merda?
Have you ever seen the smile on his face?
When he sees light at the end of the tunnel?

This is a mistake that will cost him lives
This is a betrayal that will leave him in pain

Tell me once again
What do you see
When you're not thinking hard
What do you see
When you're not thinking long

This is a terrible burden that must be lifted
I know it's easier to walk away
than look it in the eye
But it's not like my son
It's not like my son
No I can't take it
It's too late for me
Just let it pass
there's too much left
Too much left

This is a burden that must be lifted
I know it's easier to walk away
than look it in the eye
But it's not like my son
It's not like my son
No I can't take it
It's too late for me
Just let it pass

Tell me once again
What do you see
When you're not thinking hard
What do you see
When you're not thinking long

This is a mistake that will cost him lives
This is a betrayal that will leave him in pain

"Strapped For Traffic"

This is a general feeling
I don't always get through
like falling off a ship
This is a dislocated leg
I'm bound and broken
Not gonna play ball

This is a terrible pain in the ass
Sometimes I'm out of my head
And this is all I get
when I'm pulled over
for what I've done
in a dark alley
I kind of feel the same
as you
but I'm in the dark
because I don't wanna be around you for long

This is a terrible burden that must be lifted
I know it's easier to walk away
than look it in the eye
But it's not like my son
It's not like my son
No I can't take it
It's too late for me
Just let it pass

Strapped For Traffic

Drive on traffic
Never stop on the light
While you're getting off
You're lying in wait

High school dropout
Likeliest to be murdered
And why don't we all?

Drive on traffic
Never stop on the light
While you're getting off
You're lying in wait

"Collapse The Light Into Earth"

I won't shiver in the cold
I won't let the shadows take their toll
I won't cover my head in the dark
And I won't forget you when we part

Collapse the Light Into Earth

I won't heal given time
I won't try to change your mind
I won't feel better in the cold light of day
But I wouldn't stop you if you wanted to stay

Collapse the Light Into Earth

"Drown With Me"

So you have been of use
And you have been abused
You know you look pale today
Your lipstick has gone astray
You sold out and lost your looks
You gave away all your books
(You should drown with me)
Your coil has been wound up tight
Unwind it with me tonight
(You should drown with me)
Tyre tracks Fresh on the ground
Where she will be found
Held under the water
Resting there in a stream
View from the cold water
Buried in green
Orange filter sky
Your drowning in family there
When will you come up for air
(You should drown with me)
Don't feel you let 'em down
Cos they are already dead
(You should drown with me)

"Chloroform"

Little retrograde, wonder where you are
Another motorcade, under radar
A boy in borrowed clothes tracks his way to his mother's
TUESDAYS
INT. THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

[Daryus:]

Give me your pen
Let me show you something
Something pretty, something to look at
Swear your name is behind you

Sunrise into the moonlight
