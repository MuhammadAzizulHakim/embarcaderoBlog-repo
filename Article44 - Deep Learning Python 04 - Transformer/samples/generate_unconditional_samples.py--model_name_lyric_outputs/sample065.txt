Sun, this dream you leave behind
Am I haunted?

"Deadwing"

Remembered is the tragedy that was you
Reaching for the surface.
Tearing you apart, beneath the surface.

You cannot remember happiness, peace, or love,
You must remember that a part of me is dead.

The deeper the sorrow, the deeper the sorrow
And as you extend your hand up
The deeper the sorrow, the deeper the
Cleansing you form.

It is the most terrible thing that I can remember
You must see the ceiling in your mind.
Tragic surprise, I realize
But never one that I expected...

And as I'm reaching for the surface
I realize the other hand is also deep beneath
And as you reach for the surface
I realize the ceiling
 Under your direction I'll move further
As I come near
There is nothing left to hold on to

"Sever"

Telepath Carbon trapped under stone
Brother mother pale body is thrown
Only way I know to have fun
Fill up my blood, my veins, my lungs

ESP city streetlight on a hot Summer day
Burn down this town into the ground
A discordant sister in your choir
You get a thrill with everyday life
Coping with this change has become a lifelong obsession

ESP driving, my hands cold with the day

Every now and then I wipe the dust aside
To remember what I left behind

ESP fleeing, my eyes are blue
Sleeping with my stepfather
A cancer bedecked with sorrow

ESP in your heart, my eyes are cold
Coping with loss weighs heavy
With you in my pocket
Sitting in your car
Escaping a friendship so final
I can't seem to bring myself home

ESP, my veins red
My veins red

Forty-one years have passed
In hopeful eyes
She chases her dreams
Together we circle the stars

ESP, my veins red
My veins red

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And fix you once again

Help yourself
Soothe the pain
By loving yourself you're tearing me apart
I can't blame you
For trying to please everyone
I'm finding it's easier to talk to my
lover

It's only air
And time
Through daily life

Help yourself
By loving yourself you're tearing me apart
I can't blame you
For trying to please everyone
I'm finding it's easier to
love myself, my friend
I'm finding it's easier to talk to my
lover

It's only love
And time
Through daily life

"Conviction"

She told me lies
Said about her
Told me how proud she is of herself
And left me sobbing in the dark

You monster leave my child behind
So don't blame me
I'm your raging vampire
Bury me in the mirror
Nothing special has happened
The hellish task of caring for our
child
And there's nothing more I need
I'm your raging vampire
Bury me in the
Dark
Just Enough

She told me lies
Said about her
Told me how proud she is of herself
And left me crying in the dark

You monster leave my child behind
So don't blame me
I'm your raging vampire
Bury me in the dark
Just Enough

She told me lies
Said about her
Told me how proud she is of herself
And left me crying in the dark

You monster leave my child behind
So don't blame me
I'm your raging vampire
Bury me in the dark
Just Enough

She told me lies
Said to herself
Of course she'd lie
To make you happy
I'm your raging vampire
Bury me in the dark
Just Enough

"One Last Time"

[IX Restitution]

"One last time"

[I. REFLECTION]

Citing from Shakespearean tragedy
Another man dies
One by one the sympathy subsides
The sympathy subsides
And sympathy again
Will save me now
As the final word
Is our sure and sure thing

I am simply too tainted
To know the anguish and the pain
I must remain elusive
Expecting everyone
A change never my intention

[II. RESTORATION]

So I go looking for comfort
In knowing I can still
