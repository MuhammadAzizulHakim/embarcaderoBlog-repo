Programmer

Found me a way for them all to see
Something primal and real
Swallowed in my shaking hands

Beneath a wizard's mask
Underneath a mask the dead meet
Visions from timeless past

Programmer

Wept for our fathers, brothers and sisters
Wash your hands of regret
Pain and steel
Strapped down my cold shivering shoulders

"Constant Motion"

Tunnel vision at blinding speed
Controlling my thoughts, obsessing me
A shadow is observing me through night
In my darkest hour

Collapse the Light Into Earth

Missing again
Tears of sorrow wash my soul
I try to relax
As the night goes on
And on the surface this friendship fades

"The Enemy Inside"

I lost all ambition
I turned my back on ambition
I gave away all my dreams
The one-sided joke
Is still around in my head

Everything seemed so random
Suddenly I knew
Something was amiss
In my head

Stranded in the rain
Under water for the second time

Without love and without hope
I was like all my brothers
I didn't want to begin
With sharecropping tale
To end this misery

And she could have stayed
She had the upper hand
She exposed my erratic mind
But she'd never let me down

And so I cried
Heavy losses greeted me
In her arms I'd fallen
She turned and called me
My name
She smiled at me
Writing me a letter once again
Lost in this moment

Without love and without hope
I was like all my brothers
I didn't want to begin
With sharecropping tale
To end this misery

And she could have stayed
She had the upper hand
She exposed my erratic mind
But she'd never let me down

"Anna Lee"

Helpless smile
A parting so innocent
Tragic friendship forged

She's finding her voice
A million voices somehow

Finding her voice
The pain and the sorrow
Overwhelming and overwhelming

Helpless smile
A parting so innocent
Tragic friendship forged

Why is it that I'm left alone
When all I want to do is cry
Have a thought that fills me
Next thing that I know
I'm hopeless and lonely

I feel so bad for those around me

[abeth:]
I'm sorry for what I have done
I am truly sorry
For what I have done
For what I have said
It's only the beginning
And the way we are all feeling
It's all the same
Nervousness sinking deep inside
I'm finding it hard to hang

"This Is A Routine Life"

I'm not saying anything new
I'm just saying that sometimes it's just better to live your life
than to be left alone
This is a routine life. I'm not saying anything new
I'm just saying that sometimes it's just better to live your life
than to be left alone
And this is no different. I do not plan to leave my family and this tragic events
will not happen to them.

This is a routine life. I'm not saying anything new
I'm just saying that sometimes it's just better to live your life
than to be left alone

I don't recall how I got here
but I understand why some people think that way

I just don't remember how I got here
do I understand why some people think that way

It's no fun to be left out
There's something
