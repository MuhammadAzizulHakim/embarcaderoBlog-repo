======================================== SAMPLE 32 ========================================
About the devil
The ultimate prize just won't avail
You must accept it or leave
You prize glory and power
Way out of your control

Desperate addict
Taking all you can handle
And spewing forth another man

Delusional addict
Reaching for the dark
And keeping all people in the dark

Angry mobster
His finger on the pulse
Dripping black matter
All the buttons on his dashboard

Police baton down his every move
Release his aching brain
Possessive obsessions
Depressing, hating, and losing you

Madame Attorney general
Can't you see her face?
Holding your blood cold and black
I can't tell you which one is yours

How can I feel abandoned and miles from home?

The hours in the sales pitch
Confused and lost
Between narcotics and stare and sex
It's never enough
You're never enough
And underwhelmed by your captive mind

Desperate addict
Taking all you can handle
And spewing forth another man

Dirty street girl
Get a hold of the best girl
Drug lord inside

You feel like you're stepping on top
To the exposed skin

"Scene Nine: Finally Free"

[Hypnotist:]
You feel the heat again
You shiver with trepidation
Balanced on my shoulders

Open eyes now
Serendipating thoughts
She is healing from a disease
From which I long to heal

From a catastrophic experience
I've seen the true face of our times

No longer can I hold you down

I can't help feeling
The ether is burning
As I've come so clear

Open eyes now
I can help you see
The face of our times

No longer can I hold you down

There's a peace I'm searching
No longer can I hold you down

And after that day
What will become of us?
If we remain this way

"The Amen Corner"

The darkened oasis
Where virgin dreams are stolen
And sex is a thing of the past

Blinding light as the moon rises
 DEEPING into the night

Blinding light as the moon rises
DAEPING into the night

Blinding light as the moon rises
DYING

As I am reaching for the keys
I am reaching for the future
I am reaching for the unknown

When the serpent is at my side
My body is his lair
I watch him from above
Swept away
into the void
Of dreaming

Darkness is observing
The eye will soon release
As much venom as I need

I'm reaching for the unknown

When the serpent is at my side
My body is his lair
I watch him from above
Swept away
into the void
Of dreaming

And when the serpent is at my side
My body is his lair
I watch him from above

My mind is circling back and forth
It always burns me to stay

When the moon is rising up high
I can see now who is surfing
On the other side of this divide
Meant to be and who to hurt
Just like the angel of thy faith
Blessed be the one who understands

Meant to be and who to fear
Me and this man is harboring resentment
Might melt into thin air
A stone's throw from home

Servants of the fallen
Fight or flight
depending on how you choose to slice it
Remember when we were told we're here to stay?
This is your time.

"These Walls"

These walls are my own twisted vision
These walls are my own creations
Takin' in all the days
When the leaves blew for the sun
And walked upon the ground
Where flowers died and withered
And wasted years
To come, where sin took comfort
And wasted years

Citing from long lost years
The words that I hold dear
As I pass through these walls
I hear the boundless voice of forgiveness

Through the weeping eyes of men
We have come to mourn for you
And laugh at the loss of loved ones
As we pass through these walls

Praying for one forgotten
Servant
Of the fallen

[In the clothes of the demons]
What a revealing redemptive act

Without mercy, his hands were bound
As innocent life could not save that of a murderer
Suffering the loss of all innocence

As I pass through these walls

Praying for one forgotten
Servant
Of the fallen
