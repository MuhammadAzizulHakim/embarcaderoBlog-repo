Sucker Punch

How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Punishment for heresy
No mercy for the under-achiever
What would you say to this creature
Who would ever dream of deposing me
And crushing my head against the door

How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Punishment for heresy
No mercy for the under-achiever
What would you say to this creature
Who would ever dream of deposing me
And raining death down on the innocent

[V. To Ridiculously Low Ease]

It takes a village
Reds and yellows
Silent cities that mirrored our own
Reds and yellows
Roll the garbage cans and shiver

Amidst savannahs bloom
The air is thick with insects
Dusk shuffle across the country
The veins in your brain
Are wired with pain

Every waking hour
A chance for dream-like dreams
Locked inside this endless nightmare

"Dark Matter"

Inside the vehicle the coldness of the voice
Is causing me conduits to burn

If I am to survive
There must be a way
For the higher the flow of blood
And the answers to my prayers
My Master's plan
Worked out in my head
And I am ready

Like a cancer scare
A bleeding heart heard
But I was saved by faith

Behind the wheel of death
There is another breathing
He is the engine
Cleaning me up
I am the catalyst

When a man has given up
On misery
Then there is no turning back

When the rivers meet
There is no turning back

"Transcending Time"

Drifting in a far off place
I roam the countryside
Seeking wings of thought
Waiting in the blind

Enchanted and transfixed
I am pulled into the still
By a backward ticking clock
That ticks along with the story
That my skin is shaking
Drifting in a far off place
I roam the countryside
And seeing
What my mind is really made of

"Dark Matter"

Inside the vehicle the coolness of the wind
Pours aldehydes the solvent
That holds my soul together
Electric diphenhydes the solvent
That holds my soul together

A watch has been found on my person
In the past few days the narcotics stopped flowing
And I don't feel any strange

I've got a feeling
A dream I've got me something
I've got me a car
It's all because I'm searching for
An answer to my prayers

"Black Dahlia"

I don't know why
If I die
Of my sins
Or of my love
Or of my life

In this earthly world
Where we worship
We lie, we cry
We wait to see our savior

Waiting in the white light
Of her light
And his presence's no more
Tensionless projection kept me sane

I reached for heaven
And there I found him dancing on my grave

Playing over musical instruments
Playing over real life

Waiting in the red and blue

Playing over real life

Waiting in the red and blue

And still life never changes
It never will without you
If you don't give up

Waiting in the white light
Of his presence's no more
Tensionless projection kept me sane

I reached for heaven
And there I found him once again
playing over real life

I had to wait and watch his fragile reflection in
The mall, for that matter
It was wonderful sight
Another spectacle made me sick
I remember his voice calling for me
One second at the very least

Waiting in the red and blue

Playing over real life

Waiting in the red and blue

Playing over real life

"The Wilde Flowers"

Sun hangs high, I turn away
Failure underground
Heart is sick and fever is high
Waiting in the wind
Helpless and motionless
I am in the air
Waiting in the sky

<|endoftext|>

"Space Wind"

You are outside waiting
Outside waiting
Waiting inside the unknown

Waiting inside the unknown

Waiting inside the unknown

Spiritual eclipse
Your shadow is still as black as the ground
Gives way to death
Unfolding probe
Scanning for life
Waits until the background sings
Your voice is as loud as the street
Screams of dismay is all too common

Waiting inside
