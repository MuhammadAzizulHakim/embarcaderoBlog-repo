Life Span - Answer Paradoxically
Deliver a purpose
In a routine progression

When I'm down I drive the hearse

"Porcelain Heart"

[Bonus track]

Feel the pain
Feed the fear
White knuckles on the piano
This bone chilling silence
Is the anthem for you
Bipolar disorder
Addicted to the pain
Feel the love burning inside
I'm the same

I'm down
I'm lying

"Electronic Soul Control"

Tell me not what you see
Change the state of mind
Electronic soul control

Tell me not what you see
Change the state of mind

OK what's next
?
Get up, get a good looking young man
Change the state of mind
This is not the time
Take my hand or we will kill you.

Kill me, kill me now
I can't see beyond the haze
The body against the wall
Waiting for flesh
This image of hers
Is a mirror image of yours
Still hers to covet

The noise from the outside
Shows therawdownloadcloneembedreportprint text of their conversation
Like a ghost within
Killers of gender, race and ages
Photographs and publishes
its place in history
Copies of his mind
Opens a gate
He had a heart that size
He sailed in disorder
But as she turned around he was gone

Messenger of truth
Received no mercy
From a god of war
Like a trail of destruction
That no-one will return

Killers of gender, race and ages
Photographs and publishers
its place in history
Copies of her mind
Opens a gate
She said there is no turning back
He left us nothing to lose

Killers of gender, race and ages

What do you stand
If you lost your pride
Then face the camera
It's time for you to make your mark

"The Shattered Fortress"

[These lyrics are played backwards:]
"The final destiny
Wrapped in a veil
Its face midway through the moonlight
This tempest would not leave a stain
It was always burning in my heart
fuels of hate inside
never ending to divide me
andptions in my head
"The beast inside"

I am not rejected
I am loved and respected
Some will eat my soul
Others will send me back

It is a fate I am awaiting
I am a sinner and there is no love
For a thief and a saviour
Neither can I deserve these things

It is meant to be
You steal the truth
And those who choose to lie
Keep the beast inside
In my head
I will find the truth
As I speak
I am watched and feared
In my heart is full of doubt
I am breaking down

"Bonnie The Cat"

If I would
Sleep with you
And comfort you
I would
Woah the songs
The cage match
The sex tape
The therapy, the sex tape

I am in the music business
And you're my family
So if I could find you
In the music business, I'd
Wash your hands of regret
Pain of bearing the blame
For any mistakes you make

I am ready to roll with the times
In the music business I'm ready to roll with the times

"Anna Lee"

On the train back here in the morning
I stitched her name on the window pane
And let the cold winter lie in the offing
She's standing by my bed
It's raining deep in Russia
I'm turning away
She comes over to see me play
And she said
I'm sorry if I'm not around
As I kiss her she said
You're standing by the wayside

I am ready to roll with the times
In the music business I'm ready to roll with the times

"Anna Lee"

There I was
With the memory of a boy
Supposedly the devil
Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell

I was baptized into the devil's world
A member since childhood
Passing all the tests
Though I was weak and numb
I was destined to be so

I look back
