To learn from their mistakes

Keep the faith and the spirit
Through nature's inflexible
Garden can do no wrong
No evil is born
The flame of revolution
Will shine for all
When we learn to live
Together we'll build a new world
And our children's book
All about learning
When kindness won't pay the rent
Learn to live
As a people we're sold

"Learning To Live"

[rss-ubsc,adr:]

Listening to the viper
Pushing and shoving the artery
Choking reflex to the bone
Ignorant head carries the clear light
Left behind, it was me
Right from left
Liar
A tick without a sound
Distorted mirror image
Blinding light as the dying hash
Senses perfect as a black sun

A bleeding heart's sign for you
A silver lining for the thralls
A conscience for the cull
A benefit road that is still the turning stone

Radiant I feel given, free of guilt,
Like I'm joining the wrong train
Radiant I feel given, free of guilt,
Like I'm joining the wrong train

Radiant I feel given, free of guilt,
Like I'm joining the wrong train

Radiant I feel given, free of guilt,
Like I'm joining the wrong train

[b) Keeping Things New Away
(Get Your Lid, Get Your Lid)

Summer's gone - she's moved out
to a place where she belongs
And now she can't remember what she's lost
She knows nothing - she's moved out
to a place she knows will stay

And now she can't remember what she's lost
She knows nothing - she moves out
to a place she knows will stay

And she'll never walk away
She'll never be free
And she'll never be able to remember what she's lost

When I'm told that she'll never again
She'll smile and tell me to go
And she'll never want to know what it's like to lose your own child
When I'm told that she'll never again
She'll tell me how proud she is of her
 She wasn't born
But she'll always know
what she's got is all the answers
at hand

When I'm told that she'll never again
She'll smile and tell me how proud she is of her

She was taught to write
and look after her own life
By a school that teaches most students
Only nine% have the chance
That you'll ever need
That you'll never be able to remember what you lost

When I'm told that she'll never again
She'll smile and tell me how proud she is of her

"Walk The Plunge"

This song leaks out onto the pavement
It could be the end of a dream or a nightmare
It could be the beginning of the end of a nightmare
It will be the end of you being me
It will be the end of you being me

And even though it may seem so far away
even if it doesn't seem so far away
the truth is clear to me

"One Less"

Even though it may seem so far away
even if it doesn't seem so far away
the truth is clear to me

<|endoftext|>

"Walk The Plunge"

The third eye on the surface
Tearing bones from the love in you

The light that burns in your soul
Like ailing trees and bridges
Sits at the end of a road
Where the 2 get lost and the 1 comes up empty

The first sign of the new year
A declining friendship
Lives on the ground
The 2 get lost and the 1 gets strong

The light that burns in your soul
Like ailing trees and bridges
Sits at the end of a road
Where the 2 get lost and the 1 comes up empty

"Knuckle Up And Slip Away"

Heart sick with weed and china
But these empty dreams keep on coming
She keeps going
She will get stranger by getting stranger by
the minute

Nothing seems to satisfy her
Like blacking out, costing her her her looks
And when the time is up

Staring down into the ground
Waiting for the day when she will disappear

Nothing is what I feel
Like it's my last
She keeps returning

Waiting for the day when she will disappear
