======================================== SAMPLE 91 ========================================
The devil's got something new in store.
Bought, too fast.
Sold, too soon.
Got nothing more to buy.

Into the orchard I walk,
Faint light from the glowing charnel.
Blind eyes pitying
A soldier's worst nightmare.
Should I forgive her?
Oh, quite a few reasons why

Greedy pretending blood hispanic
Like the devil's with you?
These are his,
His blood your honoring blood
And he wants what's left of you.

Greedy pretending blood hispanic

His blood your honoring blood

Greedy pretending blood hispanic

"Viper King"

Venomous
By design
Lying idle
Biding time

Bore down the clutch
Tore up the road
Six hundred horses
Genetic code
Maggies inside
Ready to explode

Power's not an act
It's understanding truth
Changing my direction

Clutching your blood
Holding your head up
Don't dare speak of ending it

'Cause it's one that you'll neverx

Take this day at hand

Turn down the music
Watch the vampire spike

Turn down the music
Watch the vampire spike
Watch the vampire spike

"Closure"

Heal myself-a feather on my heart
Look inside-there never was a start
Peel myself-disappears at every turn
Returning window dressing
I'm beginning to wonderwhat have I done to deserve
This is my last chance
It's cripplingly close

Have I done to Reggie's love as I would have them do
Now I'm getting nervous-I really regret this
The way I wrote it-I wrote itup it as though I'm revisiting
It's a heavy burden on my shoulders
And I'm learning to survive
It's a burden I must face

Closure
Keep calm and we'll get to know soon
Let's gaze and breathe
Halo of death

At times the dark's fading slowly
The searching for truth
Forfeit all reason to fear
Desperate to fall
Sudden and violent
When boundaries are violated

Every wretched dream
A painful addiction
It's a necessary evil
One that can't be reversed

Breaking beneath the strain
I'm hospitalized
Resting inside its violence

[Henry Rollins:]
"If you wanna stay alive longer, you must kill this fool. Because there's nothing left is standing between you and that misery. There's nothing left is standing between you and that misery. If you wanna kill off childhood and well-used pleasures, you must do just that. Kill them all. And everyone is bliss."

[Henry Rollins:]
"No narcotics involved
And no heart found wanting
So what are we gonna do

Dreamboat ending
Predictable ending

Procrastination, abuse
Like a bullet ricochetting off a wall
I wish I'd known then
Exactly what I'd done

IEStreamFrameured the knot
Clasped by incomprehension
I freed the muscle memory
That guided my every thought

I synchronized movement
With a dream of discovery
That kept my mind clear of guilt
I sought to restore sanity
By reminding me of past wrongs
That I'm not limited by my mistakes
I reopened the door
By meeting faces from dead ends
So I could research this complex game

I informed my research, injecting myself with a primal fluid
That left me calm and content
Liquid aging itself
As I recharged, transfixed by the uninvited light

Procrastination, abuse, mental unrest
Like a bullet ricochetting off a wall
I wish I'd known then
Exactly what I'd done

"Sleeping Giant"

[These lyrics are played backwards:]
Friday evening
I get up
And figure it out
By the way, there's gotta be a way
To see
All of the things that I will never see

On the freeway
Just through the shadow of the moon
The moon rises up
In a sort of trancelike state
Like a puppet master
Driven by some empty desire

I never seem to catch a break
Void of happiness
And endless sorrows
As the world watches on
As I am taken away
And all my questions are answered
