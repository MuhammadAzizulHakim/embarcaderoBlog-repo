A Drive in the Sand

Why save yourself from drowning again?
When your heart is tired, the only thing that will keep you alive is salt
A Million Lies, A Damn

"By The Pain I See In Others"

Let me taste
Let me feel
I need to know what you keep inside
No need to speak
Just let me breathe

Into the flowers
Fly away
With silver eyes and pink hair

Rising and sinking
As the days get shorter

By the lake
Lips try to hail the dawn
A lullaby gracefully walked us through the night
Let it be, never heard of again

Sitting here alone
With nothing but your hands on the wheel
We weren't given the freedom to make our own choices
It's all just feelings
A burden that we feel
To others, it's a burden to ourselves

By the lake
Licks coughs, obsessing
With no absolution sought, the memories run deep
And there's nothing left to work
(I'm on the lake, never heard the name of my friend)
And all we have is "you."

So I've washed your name from my lips
And your face from my veins
And my symbol from somewhere
And I'll take the weight, I can't laugh when I'm losing you

I'm on the lake, never heard the name of my friend
And I'm on the water
Cold sweat preening as I try to avoid question
Given time is on the line
And I shall never forget
Standing under the shoreline
A procession of plankton is busy
Skeletal warriors on the move

Sitting here alone
With nothing but your hands on the wheel
We weren't given the freedom to make our own choices
It's all just feelings
A burden that we feel
To others, it's a burden to ourselves

By the lake
Licks coughs, obsessing
With no absolution sought, the memories run deep
And there's nothing left to work
(I'm on the lake, never heard the name of my friend)
And all we have is "you."

"Sleeping Giant"

[Bonus track]

A pink bear was hiding in the recesses of my mind
A desire to explore both the physical world and the spiritual
My friend Andy kept his hand just where it has to be
He placed the giant's hide and a gift he found
And as we walked away its voice rang
Another friend Dave and I were carried away
An ancient tradition holds that the giant's will carry the way
Back to our own homes

One of our best friends from high school still survives
A physical and mental push and turn be a miracle
And we're all forever grateful

I only wish it would so easily be gone by the way it went down
But it never has to be. It perfectly fits the way it came to be

"Herd Culling"

So close to midnight
On a beautiful September day
On a dusty Winter day
Most of us were lost in the shuffle

The bear took our clothes off
Snatching our attention like a parasite
And channel surfing its way
To unsuspecting ears

I stick my hand into a hole just to find
A place to hide
In a world full of strangers
I've searched the web for advice
But no one seems to know me

I'm having so much fun
Over the course of a lifetime
While we dwell
I hope the memory will burn
As we fade from memory

Behind the lamplights
Where the children go wild
Dancing to the tune of "Let It Be"

The night is still young
And so cold
I don't think I'll miss tonight
Although I know words may struggle to convey
Still I hope night is still youngAnd so cold

I'm drawing lines through the air
Winding through the countryside
And tonight's task is simple
To sail by
The moor should Fisher be waiting
For a new beginning
In the bow of his nose

"Next of Kin"

It was a wind of change
Overrunning my spirit
The last thing I expected would be over
This sun would set and break my trance
I felt the chill in my heart
As the waves washed away
I saw the foolishness in my friend's eyes

I have always hated the sound of music
But now that I know
What it means
I will never hate anyone
All that matters now is how I will die

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open
