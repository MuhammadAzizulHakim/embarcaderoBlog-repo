======================================== SAMPLE 21 ========================================
For all you know
Before Jesus appeared to save us all
Before his earthly resurrection
Before our very eyes
Spiritual quest
Breaking glass, breaking souls
Before and forever

Before you lie down
Before you scream
Before you swear allegiance
Before you worship Jesus
Before he appeared before you all
Before his resurrection
Before his earthly nightmare
Before our very eyes

"Responsible"

(Fallout)

If you're on the road
To finding contentment
And tranquility
Find the words to write your history

You cannot keep silent
And words cannot express
What you say without regret
Says what you believe without reflection
In worship of Satan
Before he appeared
Before your very eyes

What you say without shame
Should not be taken as gospel
What you say without blame
All your life are tainted with guilt
(Everyone knows your bad behavior)
And ashamed that you did what you did
(I am sorry for your guilt, everyone knows)

You cannot keep your mouth shut
And useless lies
Beyond the line you're crossing

Reaching out to the ungrounded
Famously bold
With anger and fear
In search for a haven
In search for a place to hide

Responsible
Never leave your soul
Behind you will die

"Collapse The Light Into Earth"

I won't shiver in the cold
I won't let the shadows take their toll
I won't cover my head in the dark
And I won't forget you when we part

Collapse the Light Into Earth

I won't heal given time
I won't try to change your mind
I won't feel better in the cold light of day
But I wouldn't stop you if you wanted to stay

Collapse the Light Into Earth

"Drown With Me"

So you have been of use
And you have been abused
You know you look pale today
Your lipstick has gone astray
You sold out and lost your looks
You gave away all your books
(You should drown with me)
Your coil has been wound up tight
Unwind it with me tonight
(You should drown with me)
Tyre tracks Fresh on the ground
Where she will disappear
This way no one will know
(You should drown with me)

She will lie down tonight
She is too poor to know
You are strong and beautiful
She will move like a leaf on the tree
You should drown with me

She will give away all her heavy knuckles
And she will walk like a moth to ashes
She will never want another
(She should drown with me)

She will give away all her heavy knuckles
And she will walk like a moth to ashes
She will never want another
Tyre Tracks Fresh on the ground
Where she will disappear
This way no one will know

"Flicker"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans
Will tell you what to think and feel

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans
Will tell you what to think and feel

What is new here?
New start?
New adventure?

What is new here?
The start of something new
Isn't it?
Get your hands dirty
And your head up by one

You don't need much thinking
You're used to it
You're on your own
So don't be afraid to touch my hair
It's natural that you would

It's natural that you would

In a sense I'm kind
And I'm just
Yeah it's hard to meet the girl
You're staring at a wall of sound
Well maybe you should meet the girl
I'm just staring at a wall of noise
Well maybe you should meet the girl
I'm just staring at a wall of noise

Nothing is new here underneath the sun

Rain keeps crawling down the glass
The good times never seem to last
Close your eyes and take a good hard look

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans
Will tell you what to think and feel
