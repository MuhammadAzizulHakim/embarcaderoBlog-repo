======================================== SAMPLE 81 ========================================
Moment of betrayal
She is the one

Father of our children
He is our only one
Mother opposes us
He just doesn't feel the same

Shot in the back
Three times in two lives
Can't forget about the tragedies
Willingly sapping away
The hope injecting terrorizing
Something to strike fear into
The wicked
Third time's a trifling sum
Can't remember the last time
A tumble in love
Before we fall apart

Moment of betrayal
She is the one

Father of our children
He is our only one
Mother opposes us
He just doesn't feel the same

380 pages long
Rather long
 to keep up with your ambitions
and there's a cliche in your eye
File the files and let me know what goes wrong
And there it begins
I could never get over

You got into my car
Took your all and driven off
Longing for a new adventure
With our children
And bring them back to you

With the sun in our eyes
We didn't want that
Innocence faded
But we didn't want to admit it
And there it is
I can't remember the last time
I
Feet cold and eyes red
I gave away my a***
And I'm regret not more

Somewhere like a land of sorrow
Leading to destruction
When our children die
There's a metal bar etched on the ground
They were forgotten
A long lost cause
It was a one way street
A march from misery
A call to arms
In the air
A head spinning
I unlearn
Friends turning foes
It's time to make my peace overt

"Culling Voices"

Disembodied voices deepen my suspicious mood
Conversations we've never had
Can waking life sustain peace of mind?
I turn away when I hear his voice

Innocence faded
But we couldn't banish the image
from my mind
ot all through eternity
I trust in you
to raise me up
And help to make me whole

[Sample is Savior:]

"My... my mind can handle no wrong...
You've made me whole.
I can be anything I want to be.
I can be benevolent, kind, kind...
I can't be anything you want to be.

Nothing I say or do, and without conscious thought,
I'm not just anybody.
I'm not just wide apart.
I'm not just happy here.
I've got bases to cover.
There's no turning back.
I've got bases to cover."

And I can't resist myself
For I am superhuman
Even as I look on you.
I'm not afraid of dying
I am not out of reach
Even if my next of kin
Knowingly follow my lead.

To thrive as a man we must find our own way
Through life's biggest battles.

Nothing you can do about it
It's too late for us
So I'll leave the blame to you.

Nothing I say or do, and without conscious thought,
I'm not just anyone.
I'm not just happy here.
I've got bases to cover.
There's no turning back.
I've got bases to cover.
Nothing I say or do, and without conscious thought,
I'm not just anyone.
I'm not just a man
I need to dominate you like a man
And then you will fall.
You look up to me and then I command you
to take the fall.
Just let me show you just how.
Just let me show you just how.
Just let me show you just how.
Just let me show you just how.

Just let me show you just how.

[V. Surrender, Trust & Love]

To really feel the joy and ease with which you found love
trust and trust and love
go right through me, right through me now.
Trust me, trust me, trust me.

This is love at bay.
The only thing holding me back is love's part in the dark.
Hoping that this tug of war will make it stop.
That nothing is left untested, that nothing is new, will give away the one and only thing.
Hoping that nothing is left untested, that nothing is new, will give away the one and only thing.

OUT!

And for what?
For what's not yethin'?'
What's not yethin'?'

Well, if you want to know the answer, just look at what's been going on in your life for a long time.
Consider this question, "Have you had your fill of hate?
