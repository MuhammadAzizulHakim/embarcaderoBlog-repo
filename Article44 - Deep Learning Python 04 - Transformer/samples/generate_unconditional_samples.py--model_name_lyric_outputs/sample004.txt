======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================
Acting on my weakness
Reaching out to embrace the random

Random person, random breath
Suddenly I find
The strength I've forgotten
And I'm knocking
At doors that I couldn't see
Promises made
Bloodshed conflict
Flesh torn
Cymruising disease
Sickening nightmare

Random blood thirsty
Drains blood from his veins
Pours arip out his soul
Drains vitality
Slows down
Numbingly he ascends
Into the stages of decay
He's the sort of mortal who can't be trusted
He's unfaithful to his students
And his thoughts are selfish

"Beneath The Surface"

[INT. Town Square - Day]

[Daryus:]

You dare defy your prince?
Well you should go and do that
Because it might cost him a place
In the end I will give him my all
And there's something in the oath I take
I gave you life
But I never thought that you could be trusted

"Honor Thy Father"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Faythe:]

We defy the will of our enemies
And rise up against the wishes of our enemies

We worship the shadows
And fraternize with the dark
And we forge our own paths to reach out
And maybe even climb out of the dark

We're not afraid of letting our secrets pass
We're not too bold
We're not too bold
We're not too bold

Standing up for humanity
We're breaking through the walls

[Arabelle:]

Give me your hand
(We're bound to ride on)
And help to give hope
to all our doubters
And this will be your last

We're bound to ride on forever
And this will be your last time
At last our battle
Born to meet and fall together
This will be your last time
At last our moment of victory

Brother and mother
We're bound to ride on forever
And this will be your last time
At last our moment of victory

"In The Presence Of Enemies, Pt. 1"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Daryus:]

Arhys and X
Are the best of friends
Although they're not the greatest
We got along so well

I got tired of fighting
Of fighting you was my friend
He's our brother now

[Arhys:]

Yeah
I kinda like him
He's a very special man
How can I not like him?

[Xander:]

I'm sorry for being blunt
I'm sorry for being blunt
But you're the reason why this happens
And I'm the reason why this happens

[Daryus:]

Yeah
I kinda like him
He's a very special man
How can I not like him?

[Henry:]

I kinda like him
He's a very special man
How can I not like him?

[Xander:]

You're the reason why this happens
And I'm the reason why this happens
Now shut up and listen

[Henry:]

Sorry
You're being profane
You're being profane
You're the reason why this happens
And I'm the reason why this happens

[Daryus:]

Yeah
I kinda like him
He's a very special man
How can I not like him?

[Ensemble:]

Watching us in the fifties
I remember home we had always happened
And then we moved to a new place
And I saw the lights flash
There's a new love that takes form
Outside the walls we pass by
Every home is new and strange

I remember when I burned my friend
For everything that I did
And left him to die alone
I was right
Home.

"Heartattack In A Layby"

A local boy is getting really, really upset
And he's trying to tell his cousin he's sorry
The sun is burning hot and his coat is cold
And his mind is racing
With all of his dreams in the garbage

And his hand is full with red and blue UR baguettes
And his hair is in the mud

As his hand is full with nothing
And as her is full with nothing
And her is full of it

Sadistic playthings like that
Getting right in your face
When you screw it up
You're gonna win the sympathy race

Crushed dreams that will
