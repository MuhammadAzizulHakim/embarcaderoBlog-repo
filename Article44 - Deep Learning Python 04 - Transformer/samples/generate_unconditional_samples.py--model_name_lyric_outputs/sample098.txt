And what kind of man
If he thought he could change the world
Well, what kind of man
Would put his life on the line
To save a child
Or fighting a war
Or looking after a pet
Or all of their lives
So why are we dying
In the year of his splendour.

"The Gift Of Music"

It has been a long, silent, lonely life
I've been struck by a light that burns a fuse
And I've sought the remedy in a dream
But music has left a scar that'll never fade away

And without love there's no love
Without truth there's no learning
And without faith there's no salvation
And without God there's no salvation
There's no salvation
If we're washed away
In the form of death
There's no salvation
For us to adore
Or pouring out our souls
There's no salvation
For us to shun
Such an hour
As weSROE

It's been a long, silent, lonely life
I know the pain
To find I never felt so alive

And the love we keep
Is never stronger than now
As we move through this uncertain world

"Waiting - Phase One"

Waiting - Phase one

Is the end of this story?

No more battles
No more losses

I will wait for you
Until the end
And there will be no more pain
For us to say goodbye

Waiting - Phase two

Is the end of this story?

No more battles
No more losses

I will wait for you
Until the end
And there will be no more pain
For us to say goodbye

Waiting - Phase three

Is the end of this story?

No more battles
No more losses

"The Wilde Flowers"

Sun hangs high, I turn away
Failure underground
I never take another step
I am never closer to your cause

Sitting in my cab
It's September and I'm in Wales
Getting ready to leave
I've been waiting for you all this time

Waiting - Phase one

Attention starts to wonder
As I look through his empty eyes

Waiting - Phase two

I'm waiting

"Light Sleeper"

I got an open mind
I was exposed to beautiful people
But after a while
You tell me "I can feel the buzz
As your light comes on
Like a bullet hurtles off the wall"

I get high
I get low
I get dirty
I get belligerent
I got no respect
No love
No lies

I get high
I get low
I get belligerent
I got no respect
No love
No lies

I got an open mind
I was exposed to beautiful people
But after a while
You tell me "I can feel the buzz
As your light comes on"

"Hooker With A Penis"

I met a boy wearing Van, 501,
And a dope Beastie T,
Nipple rings
New tattoos that claimed that he
Was OGT,
Back from '92,
From the first EP.

I'm out of money
I'm out of dreams
I'm out of control
I'm out of control
I want to be the man who I am meant to be.

Can I call you on the telephone, howdy buddy?
I just met a boy in the news,
He's in the hospital. Howdy buddy!

Howdy buddy!

"Blackest Eyes"

I know the streets
I know the sounds
I know the streets
And I don't care what they say
I'm on the road

If I don't stop to savour on the red glare
Of strangers passing by

Look down...

 Valdez, VÃ¡clav
Gabriel, turn it on
Open your eyes
And stop searching for more than you need

Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Dry menses the wounds it heals
Mold and wallow in the maze of its victory

The eye of the state
The precursor of all wisdom
It is our sworn enemy

Staring down...

Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Dried up in muddy waters
And losing ground
As our fearless leader take his place

Staring down...

Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Dried up in muddy waters
And losing ground
As our fearless leader take his
