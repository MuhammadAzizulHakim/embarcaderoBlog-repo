======================================== SAMPLE 70 ========================================
An engraved chest with a wealth of sorrows
A coat of arms is no more
I am gone
They took my life away

Someone died for me
Not just for the cause
But for the hopeful
Unwelcome stranger
There is no reason why

"Message to Harry Manston"

Figlio di puttana, sai che tu sei un pezzo di merda?
Can't remember what they say
but I know what they say
rapid-fireballing-around
You tried and you're finding us
getting nowhere
then you're slithering
slow-fingered-son-on-the-street
You tell me who's the tycoon
and who's the snooty chicken pox
now I know who the tycoon

You're trying to buy a place in my living room
and I'm letting you down
my dear
you're choking, spitting and it takes forever to catch your breath
because you're so new
and why now so soon?

Fuck you for what you've seen
what they choose
and they don't wanna see you through the window
because it's too hot there's too much rain
oh oh
oh oh oh oooh
oh oh oh
oh oh oh ooh
oh ooh

Now that you're understandin' me
what I believe
cha gotta ta stay
craving for love and peace inside this cold off-and-on
oh
oh oh oh ooh
oh oh oh
oh oh oh

Keep pushin' 'round' round 'til we're lovein' each other
Keep comin' 'round 'til we're wayin'
Way down!
Won'cha-
TURN-AR-Gonna-die-at-end of.

"Pull Me Under"

Lost soul energy
Received word received
Sent experience to
Past and future connected
Unconditioned, gone astray

Vacant, derelict
Out of reach, or wanting
Out of reach, or wanting

Waiting...

Whispered chills rise
Words spill from my mouth
Pour me into her chest

Vacant, derelict
Out of reach, or wanting
Out of reach, or wanting

Waiting...

Weakness fading
Hope calling me
Calling me back
Leaving me nowhere to lay

Pull me under Pull me under
Pull me under I'm stay, stay
Wave goodbye to all of you

Waiting...

Weakness fading
Hope calling me
Calling me back
Leaving me nowhere to lay

Waiting...

Weakness fading
Hope calling me
Calling me back
Leaving me nowhere to lay

Waiting...

"Flicker"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light to come
Only the man who made the changes
Will tell us what to think and feel
Just a flicker of the light to come
Only the man who made the changes
Will tell us what to think and feel

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light to come
Only the man who made the changes
Will tell us what to think and feel

"Strip The Soul"

This beat makes me want to kick ass
This beat makes me want to watch top shelf
It makes me feel dirty to even higher

See how I drape my skin with my bare hands?
This is my bare hands
We're reaching for the glass
And I can barely make it through the pouring rain

This is my bare hands
We're reaching for the glass
And I can barely make it through the pouring rain

This is my bare hands
We're reaching for the glass
And I can barely make it through the pouring rain

This is my bare hands
We're reaching for the glass
And I can barely make it through the pouring rain

"Black Dahlia"

You have no interest in the past
Where you came from
Where you're going to

There's a cliche in your eye
File the edges down
Soon be underground

There's nothing here for you under the sun
There's nothing new to do, it's all been
