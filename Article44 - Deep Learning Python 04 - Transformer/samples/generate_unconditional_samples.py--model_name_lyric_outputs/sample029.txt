Victoria
One last chance to prove her worth to mankind
And free her from further misery

Victoria lifts her head to show the world that she's me
Victoria lifts her head to show the world that she's me

Free her from naught
Closure suffocating pain
Pain inside and beyond desperate
Stay the hell away from my daughter
Freed from the shackles of night

She's free from all guilt and pain
She's bright and innocent and happy
Free her soul from the shackles of night

Come to me my daughter now
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe

"Barstool Warrior"

Hello, adventurer!
This is Dr. Strange
He's your Godfather, really
Unable to justify himself

I show him the way
Of greatness
and then I sit and talk to him
and say...
"You've got to know this, because I have a son who is 5 years old."

How can I keep him from choking on my pride?
By reminding him of my past?
How can I keep him from hating me?

The horrifying truth
Obscured and strewn all round me
Like a cancer scare in a field full of flowers

And I don't want him realizing that
I've sacrificed more than I have read

Through a selection process that systematically
Treads all my words
Sobs start to set in
As I realize that I did not choose this life
As I am admitting it

How can I keep him from choking on his pride?
By reminding him of my past?
How can I keep him from hating me?

The horrifying truth
Obscured and strewn all round me
Like a cancer scare in a field full of flowers

And I don't want him realizing that
I've sacrificed more than I have read

"Baby Dream"

I am dreaming of a tomorrow
In a world of secrecy and war
I am the new Karkandria

I'ma break up the boughs that keep swaying
To and fro in the tide of time
I'ma dance to and fro in the past
And here I am the girl who you thought kept you sane
She's the one who taught you to hate
You thought of me as a burden of love
And she's the one who died the night to bring me back again

Every memory is new and constantly changing
Depending on a shuddering will
On a feeling that never comes back

I'ma dance to and fro in the past
And here I am the girl who you thought kept you sane
She's the one who taught you to hate
You thought of me as a burden of love
And she's the one who died the night to bring me back again

Every memory is new and constantly changing
Depending on a shuddering will
On a feeling that never comes back

Baby Dream
Dreaming of a tomorrow
With dignity and love
We'll bounce 'round the end
So we may go back again

I'ma dance to and fro in the past
And here I am the girl who you thought kept you sane
She's the one who taught you to hate
You thought of me as a burden of love
And she gave you the keys to her home
So dance to and fro in the past
And remember these are your last rites

So dance to and fro in the past
And remember these are your last rites
Oh no no no no no no

"Trains"

Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hiss of the train at the railway head
A scream for help rising up the ladder
A hiss and a whistle repeating
"everything is clear"

I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hissing subsides
I've got the feeling that the world is back

I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hissing subsides
I've got the feeling that the world is back

I've got the railway winds tearing at her heart
I've got the feeling that she would scream and hurt you
But it's getting colder by the minute
And I don't mind the way she dresses
She never smiles much (unless it's for you)
She's a woman but she can't be a man
And I don't think that helps in the long run

She's a girl but she wants to be a man
And I don't think that helps in the long run
