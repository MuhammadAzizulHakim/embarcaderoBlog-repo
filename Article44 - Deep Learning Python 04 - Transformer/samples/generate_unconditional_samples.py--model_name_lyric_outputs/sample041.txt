The embryonic moon had formed a ring around us all
Now we could stare the problem right in the eye
Cause it was our,
Problem was born it was your
Children who were dying – they were you
Father, the tyrants
And mothers cried – they cried – they cried

Until you took my hand and we drove on
The moon through the glass
Darkness reared its head
And you were beyond all help
The apathetic winds of rational thought
Would pull you out of your own wreckage
And help to give you strength to fix your mind
If only I could find
One way to bring you back

How dare you step inside my courtyard!

My dear friend, your face is shaking with grief
I know you well. You must be in a mental institution
I know you best, for you are just a poor girl

You will be her mirror, reading the world from daddy's eyes
I know you best, best, son

How dare you step inside my courtyard!

I will stay in my place
While father and son wait

Out in the wasteland
They are developing a hatred for humans
Not just for this place
They are developing a hatred for humans

[Gabriel:]

I never knew
Before you held me.
Unwelcome and hostile alike
It's plagued my life and it's plagued my family
I'm almost certain death's not upon us
Yet...

It's one that I'll never live through.

It's one that I'll never live by.

It's nine o'clock at night
Where I crawl and fall again
To find I've never been so alone and so high
And nine o'clock at night
I'm almost certain death's not upon us
Yet...

It's one that I'll never live by

And it's nine in the morning when Gabriel calls me
and I'm looking out the window
And nine in the morning when Gabriel calls me
I'm almost certain death's not upon us

Yet...

You dare to stand
Before my eyes
You're one of them
You had better find another
You wait to find another
You wait to be alone and lost
You wait to be alone and lost

And it's almost like I got bored
I don't care where I stand
I just get wasted
It's almost like I got bored
I don't care what color I is

I got wasted into all of your silence
Where I waited for you when I finally stumbled
I got wasted into all of your silence

When I heard the voice of tomorrow
I knew it was coming, it rang with a resounding "Yes!"
I knew it would ruin my day
And it must have been a terrible mistake
to let you down
I knew it would leave me with nowhere to go

What did you say?
You dare to stand
Before my eyes
You're one of them
You had better hurry up and find another
You waited for your salvation
Now you're one less soul to bear

[Faythe:]

You dare to stand
Before my eyes
You're one of them
You've got a place to live
You're a burden to be left alone
You situate all of your thoughts
In front of you, useless and threatening
You make every attempt to comfort and pacify
Yet you're always stuck
unless of course you're wrong

And there's something you can do
To save you, a child of war
Or a memory that won't die, forever
Let the words of this statement guide you
Through the fire of vengeance

You dare to stand
Before my eyes
You're one of them
You've got a place to live
You're a burden to be left alone
You situate all of your thoughts
In front of you, useless and threatening
