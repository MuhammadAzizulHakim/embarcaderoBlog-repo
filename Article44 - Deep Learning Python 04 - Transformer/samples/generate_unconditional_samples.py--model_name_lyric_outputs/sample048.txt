======================================== SAMPLE 48 ========================================
Without solid evidence
Therefor, circumstantial
The light of day, the moon, Jupiter's rod

Without a firm grip, the race has not begun
There is probability in days
Of chance
In jest, we speak of fables
One faith, one hope
For the risen and the sign of the Mart
While the street, monarchy
Divided, the blind man, behold
The celestial touch, from slate to glass

Without solid witness
Therefor, circumstantial
The light of day, the moon, Jupiter's ball
And the Mart
While the world sleeps, we're indistinguishable

Without faith, power, and might
Therefor, I speak only with will

Without a doubt, the lips of water are closed
As if severed
Without conscious experience
I have been severed

Without conscious experience
I have been
Am I the way you say I am?
When I see the reflection in your eyes
It makes me feel the cold wind readingjusting
As if I was washed away

Without solid witness
Therefor, I speak only with will

Without a doubt, the lips of water are closed
As if severed
Without conscious experience
I have been severed

Without conscious experience
I have been
Am I the way you say you am?
When you say you're right
There is no such thing as right

Without firm grip, the race has not begun
There is noossibility of saving face
There is no beauty but at the death of fashion
There is no faith but a test
Before we set out on our ways we must learn to face our sorrows
Before we can begin to live on our own
Before we can begin to live on our own

Spiritual eclipse
Beginnings hard at work
Redemption light
Learning from misery

"Along For The Ride"

Some will find the guilt
Others the innocence

Not the beads on their skin
Too much attention much too soon

High in the air
Controlling my life
With no conscience
Innuiable chasm of identity

Liar
Liar
Liar
Liar

[ENGLISH:]
'High in the sky, grinning'
One tail behind me
Heading for the top
A parade of triumph
A thousand fires burning
In celebration of my country's cause

"Back on the farm"
[Possibly a parody of the modern way]

Weighing the harvest, we are sold
Thechecks, theror's on the belt
Unexpected demands, obstacles ahead
We iron fence, fence,
Tie together, tie along
As we go sliding
We make switch, twist together

Sleeping with our fathers
We make switch, twist together
Unwelcome arrival, obstacles ahead

Pushing, pushing, pushing
Narrowed
Lazy
Midnight shift

Overwhelmed
With ADHD's and operating on a wheelchair
Getting into the car, not much to do

Liar
Liar

"Runaway Car"

It's the smell of gasoline in my head
Signs in the blinds
On the windowsill
That tell me nothing has been lost
I look under the covers
But when I turn my head I can't see
And break down crying

The third eye on the ceiling
Told me that books are my only escape
And now I've found my calling
as a watcher in the night
shows me the way to salvation
via the tears of someone who fears me

Run away with me
Find all the answers
from the burning wanton wreckage
that sits just outside my door
and then run away with me
because I don't want to face another day

The third eye on the ceiling
Told me that books are my only escape
And now I've found my calling
as a watcher in the night
shows me the way to salvation
via the tears of someone who fears me

Run away with me
Find all the answers
from the burning wanton wreckage
that sits just outside my door
and then run away with me

Told me that books are my only escape
And now I've found my calling
as a watcher in the night

"Surrounded"

Will the children cry
When their mother dies
And in the autumn of their lives
Will they feel the same?

[x2]
Captured in a moment of weakness
Outside the pulse
