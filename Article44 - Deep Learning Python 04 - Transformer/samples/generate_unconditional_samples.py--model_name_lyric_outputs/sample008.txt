This place you belong..."

I get stranger after stranger man on my knees
Every day I put a lifeline behind bars

Someone told me never to let a stranger get away with murder
Every day they ask me where there's been blood all my life
My blood always keeps me sane

Get up. Turn down. Go home

Seek help for fear of losing my mind
I am a shelter from tragedy
A place where strangers can always come
A place where I can never fly

A burden stays with us from what could've been seen
There's faith in us, love in us
And when death brings us closer than you can see
There's humility in us, love in you
And when we're together there's beauty in our hearts

"Angel Of Thy Blessed Mother"

Arabelle, what's happened?
You pretended not to know
And when your secrets are revealed
It will be because of you

Father, I hope you remember this promise
I'll never leave you
It's been a while
If ever you felt you weren't living up to it
You're better than the people around you

You're nothing but the underdog
You're praised around the world
But only by your own people

Beneath a cloudless sky
Where a belief holds sway
There's not much we can do

We gather inhedral around the hero
Of our mother's gentle will
And as her light inspires us
We can rejoice in her good will

Credits to a dream

We're educated but never overtired
We smile but never without shame
Balanced on a stool by ledger
Hand reaching for the odds

In her arms I am you
I'm the underdog
You're praised around the world
But only by your own people

Beneath a cloudless sky
Where a belief holds sway
There's nothing we can do

We gather inheds around the savior
Of our thirst for glory
And fist to fist fight it out
Balanced on a stool by ledger
Hand reaching for the odds

In her arms I am you
I'm the underdog
You're praised around the world
But only by your own people
Beneath a cloudless sky
Where a belief holds sway
There's nothing we can do

We gather inheds around the savior
Of our thirst for glory
And fist to fist fight it out
Balanced on a stool by ledger
Hand reaching for the odds

"Surrender To Reason"

In moments of pain and death
We sever ourselves from the natural progression

Soul harvesting
Cruel exercise
Embodied mind
Illusions of eternal sleep

We are sacrificed in moments of pain and death
Soul seeking
Immune to pain

We are sacrificed in moments of pain and death
Soul seeking
Immune to pain

Pray and violate
Abuse and survive
use and survive
False consciousness corrupts your very soul
Immune to pain

Pray and violate
Abuse and survive
False consciousness corrupts your very soul
Immune to pain

Procrastination and lethargy
Redemption for the insane
Awaiting memory
Eternal wealth
Supposedly you felt smarter then me

I am crucified for my sins
The pursuit of happiness is my only way out
My salvation's not found
My salvation's not found

I'm sacrificed in moments of pain and death
Soul seeking
Immune to pain

Procrastination and lethargy
Redemption for the insane
Awaiting memory
Eternal wealth
Supposedly you felt smarter then me

I am crucified for my sins
The pursuit of happiness is my only way out
My salvation's not found
My salvation's not found

"Disappear"

We made the world believe we didn't care
We gate crashed parties and just stood and stared
We moved to London and stayed in all year
Standing next to you I disappear

You made a choice for us to live it up
I've got a voice inside me saying give it up
Let's get out of here, let's find a new career
You be famous so I can't disappear

You wear glasses human faction, wears them every day
But in these blind cities we don't see your face

You create your own future with your eyes, in a streaming monorail
I watch you perform random acts of kindness
I hope you remember me from when you were begging me to keep you here
I'm leaving for good

I'm in a music venue and just passed through
I want to buy a guitar, but the man's
