so good.

The red would rise.
And cracks would show.
Plunging into the deepest void.
No parlor, no therapy.
Crying, "Why, why, why?
Why do you do this?"

Crying, "Why, why, why?"

No room, no therapy.
Yuck, yuck.
Your head is full of junkies.
Crying, "Why, why, why?"

No room, no therapy.
Yuck, yuck.
Your head is full of junkies.
Crying, "Why, why, why, why!"

"That was long enough. That was long enough. 'Cause he's got another plan.
He's got two sons...
They're gonna shoot him down. 'Cause he's a hero!

Why don't you watch too much Divergent?
It's so obvious who the heroes are
Why don't you watch too much Watch Always?

And after that conclusion [7x]
They'll come.
And tear down this city infinite thin.

So jump out your spines.
Hilt down your spines.

Don't stop for a second thinking about who the heroes are
They'll be coming to take you down.

After that conclusion [3x]
They'll come.
And tear down this city all over.

Now jump out your spines.
Hilt down your spines.

Don't stop for a second thinking about who the heroes are
They'll be coming to take you down.

After that conclusion [2x]
They'll come.
And tear down this city all over.

And neutralize [2x]
An easy way out.

Mob carry on.
They'll be coming to take you down.

Midget on the ground get out
While the cowards chase after their dreams
Run fast while the rabbits cry
Learn to walk and talk while the men die

Perversions reels up in the garden
And stream from one end to the other

"Face In The Snow"

Nothing like this has ever happened to me
Am I strong enough to face them?
Suddenly, I'm frightened for my life.

It's true...
All life is potential...
When you take all of it and throw it away
Does not make you strong enough to face them?

Brave, yet insecure
Tired of living as I was back then.

Hide and protect...
Stand by the devil
Until he departs...
And I'll stay inside
Until he departs...
And I'll stay inside

Nothing like this has ever happened to me
Am I strong enough to face them?
Suddenly, I'm frightened for my life
Brave, yet insecure
Tired of living as I was back then.

Hide and protect...
Stand by the devil
Until they come
And I'll stay inside
Until they come...
And I'll stay inside

Nothing like this has ever happened to me
Am I strong enough to face them?
Suddenly, I'm frightened for my life
Brave, yet insecure
Tired of living as I was back then.

"Still Day Beneath The Sun"

Avec a riche, avec a cette silence,
Avec a merda avec,
avec avec, avec,
avec avec d'Artagnan, avec a mercie

And though we may harbor some hold if not of truth
ancies we still know the apostle
And if God is our Father then we know the light
of hope
and the light that binds them
is a bright flame that binds them all

Still day beneath the sun
A shade of grey beneath a bright azure
Still it dances through the angels in heaven
And no-one is more eager to welcome them all home
Beneath the strife that is darkened skies

"The Moor"

The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays

Weary from what might have been ages
Still calm with my mind ablaze
Would I prosper or fall, drain the past
The lapse of the moment took it's turn

I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death-mask at birth
The hands of God, decrepit and thin
Cold caress and then nothing
I served the decrepit over the youthful
Nothing ever said
I was
