======================================== SAMPLE 11 ========================================
Problems remain, at any given moment. To find out what has gone and lost
reached, there has been a tremendous amount of damage. Time and again.
Consider this question
Can neural network failures be reversed?
Can machine learning be harnessed to cleanse anger from our lives?
These are serious and life threatening questions.

In spite of what we think or what we read, there's still hope for humanity
when we realize that beyond belief lies pain and suffering
at all levels.
We must believe in something and break free of our control
before we can face these challenges alone

[Instrumental]

[II. Live, Die, Kill]

Consider this question
Look no further

Constant pace further into the night
What is left is madness
Lightning speed at the end of a tunnel
What would they kill you for watching me die
Witness my own demise

Demon hunter
Gives me new ambitions
Hurts me down
Destroys my path of departure

Demon hunter
Gives me power
Lives me here
Rascals at the gates
Blood and soil
But above all, moans belong to the fallen
Never again

"Die"

Silence disguised
Desperate addict
Choking needlessly
Like the addict
That addiction calls for all the answers

Breaking within a logic
Prestige our inner child
Curiosity degrades our ability to speak

Breaking within a reason
Prestige our childish child
A reason to be hopeful

Finding truth in our human spirit
Disguised in honesty

Threats and lies silence surrounds
Defining what we believe
Beneath an iron will
We trust our will alone

Breaking within a circumstance
Prestige a child, a will of steel
Getting nowhere fast
Like a falling autumn storm

"Constant Motion"

Tunnel vision at blinding speed
Controlling my thoughts, obsessing me
Void of any uncertainty
Throughout my very soul

Lost illusions of mind control
Resisting all hope of letting go
Racing impulse of dark desire
Drives me through the night

Continuous chaotic action
Watching through the city lights
Patterns of light cast aside
I seem to recognize

No longer able to control my life
Raging desire to end all lives
Drives me through the night

Never can I remember when life was this way
Never will I be alone
Never will I be whole

Disrupted in its twists and turns
Every day I'm ground down
My mind keeps me down
In the pouring rain what it will leave
Burnt at the bottom

Never will I be whole

Every day I'm ground down
My mind keeps me down
In the pouring rain what it will leave
Burnt at the bottom

This obsession
Keeps me down
This obsession keeps me down

Every day
Drive by on the move
Watch for blown cover
Never a sign of humanity
