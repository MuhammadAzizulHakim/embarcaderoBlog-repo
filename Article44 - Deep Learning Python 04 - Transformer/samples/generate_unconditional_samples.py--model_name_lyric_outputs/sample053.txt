Father, mother and brother
Can you hear me?
I am not a killer, I am not stalking you
I am just a leader
These senseless acts of violence
That I can't control
Will set you free

"Message to Harry"

Figlio di puttana, sai che tu sei un pezzo di merda?
You think you're cool, right?
When you kicked out people out of the house
I tell you this, one of three Americans is dying out of cancer, you know?
Asshole, and you're gonna be one of those
I didn't have the courage to kick your ass directly
Don't have enough courage for that, I could, you know?
You know you're gonna have another accident? Then you'd be crucified, right?
That's what I'd, I'd be wrong.
You know you're gonna have another accident? Then you'd be crucified, right?

That's what I'd, I'd be wrong.
You know you're gonna have another accident? Then you'd be crucified, right?

Fuck you, Jesus Christ
How can I feel sorry for you
If I'm going down that road again
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
Have you tried coffee or tea?
Coffe, don't try this place
It's gonna hurt you.

"Hooker With A Penis"

I met a boy wearing Van, 501,
And a dope Beastie T,
So I knew he was trying to
Eu...

Im going to drape himself as the first man
Of His Planet, with which to bow
And then he'll, shall we say,
Sing a thousand happy tears?

Im going to have a room at the top of the stairs
And I'll have my thoughts drawn to the ceiling
And then he'll thrust his dick inside my mouth

It's not my first rodeal...

It's my eleventh.

IUD, Percutaneous - 'til
One.
 percolate through my gag reflex.
Inhibits ejaculation within a matter of seconds.
A dream-inducing reflex that leaves me motionless.

I'm praying to God that someone will swallow my
dream sickness.
I'm praying to God that someone will swallow my
dislocated upper lip.

I'm praying to God that someone will swallow my
dislocated upper lip.

I'm praying to God that someone will swallow my
dislocated upper lip.

"Flicker"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light to come
Only the people who always think they know best

"Bonnie The Cat"

Can't feel the pain that I expected
I still place keys in the ignition
I know what will be and what will be wont
So I...
I'll take whatever comes to me
Soon I will see you smile

Just let me breathe...
Nothing will come close to protecting me
And I will find a way
Just let me breathe...

Beginnings get complicated
the farther we progress
Opinions are known
and as we advance the math comes the deeper the doubt

I can't imagine why we can't try
and if we could, why don't we?
We are sending a message
that no matter how far we progress
We will always remember us as friends
and that we will always love you
If we unite at all
then we will shine
as one body holding you together

And if we unite at all
then we will shine
as one body holding you together

"Will O The Wisp"

When you're tired of waiting and hate for attention
You can look it in the eye
When you're tired of hating me, you can look it in the eye
When you're tired of sleeping with me, you can sleep it in the eye

When you're tired of hating me, you can look it in the eye
And when you're tired of hating me, you can sleep it in the eye

It helps to keep me dark
and when you're tired of sleeping with me, you can sleep it in the eye
You keep me constantly confused
and I
