======================================== SAMPLE 49 ========================================

I cannot see the meaning
Of your life I am sinking like a stone
I am drifting, like a lost child
In the mire of death
I am sinking like a stone

"Cusp Of Eternity"

In a sense I'm not beyond reproach
No I'm not above reproach
Given time is only two
And the lapse of the second day
Given trial is everyone

So as you wish me to go away
Give yourself well...lotteried
(tasting) bactrian wine
Three times in a black vessel
And upon my turning twenty-four
I'll have raised a family of my own
Given time is only two
And the lapse of the second day
Given trial is everyone

"Deliverance"

Floating on mist
Crept up the caverns of my brain
Received no warning
From nothing to a life code
Walk with me, you'll never leave
Wait to see your spirit free
Tell me how your heart's in need
As I drown you in the sea
Unwinding snares of distrust
Your wrist in my fast grip
Look me in the eye, I'm clear
This is your time
Face down beneath the waterline
Gazing into the deep
From love to death
In a time span of seconds
Oblivious to regret
Pushed into belief
In liquid cellophane
Gasping for air
Mercy in my eyes
Is the shade of the night
The piercing sounds you make
Soaring higher, higher now
And once left in my wake
Your memory is nothing but the scars on me
All over now
Forgotten why I needed this
Standing down
Disappear into the obscure
Resting days
Waiting for new disease
Biding time
Locked inside insanity
It always burns within
The downward spiral never ends
When driven into sin
Your salvation's found in a sinner's deed
The dead justify
The righteous punish
The become righteous
When we forsake God
And fall into temptation
It never ends
In a time span of seconds
Oblivious to regret
Pushed into belief
In liquid cellophane
Gasping for air
Mercy in my eyes
Is the shade of the night
The piercing sounds you make
Soaring higher, higher now
And once left in my wake
Your memory is nothing but the scars on me
All over now
Forgotten why I needed this
Standing down
Disappear into the obscure
Resting days
Waiting for new disease
Biding time
Locked inside insanity
It always burns within
The downward spiral never ends
When driven into sin
Your salvation's found in a sinner's deed
The dead justify
The righteous punish
The become righteous
When we're led like rabbits through the woods
It never ends
In a time span of seconds
Oblivious to regret
Pushed into belief
In liquid cellophane
Gasping for air
Mercy in my eyes
Is the shade of the night
The piercing sounds you make
Soaring higher, higher now
And once left in my wake
Your memory is nothing but the scars on me
All over now

"The Moor"

The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in damp earth
Snuffing the first rays

After all the years of sorrow
Could this be all that we all lost?
I reckon it is down to the memory
And the nightmares that body confuse

I must endure
To the end
Of this forest
The night in my sleep
And the footprints on my wall
Will haunt my dreams for the rest of my days

And I must endure
To the end
Of this forest
The night in my sleep
And the footprints on my wall
Will haunt my dreams for the rest of my days

And I must endure
To the end
Of this forest
The night in my sleep
And the footprints on my wall
Will haunt my dreams for the rest of my days

"Fear Inoculum"

Immunity, long overdue
Contagion, I exhale you
Naive, I opened up to you
Venom and mania
Now, contagion, I exhale you

Beating you, contagion
We're exhaling you

Inoculum, I exhale you
I'm exhaling you

"Wounds"

There's no such thing as "enough"
You try your best to be happy
But you're stuck in
