"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence"

Six Degrees OF CORNER
Who would have thought that a sixteen year old girl could stumble and fall into such a hole?

And nobody knows better
Here's a hymn to those that disappear

Never ever ever ever ever never
Never ever ever ever
Never ever ever ever


You don't know me better
All my friends are dead
There's nothing I can do for you

I swear I'll never love you again
Oh no no no no no no no

It's just another day
There's no love in fear
There's no loss of love
There's no isolation
There's no peace of mind

It's just another day
There's no love in fear
There's no loss of love
There's no testosterone
There's no peace of mind

It's just another day
There's no love in fear
There's no testosterone
There's no peace of mind

"Flicker"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatrees
Worked wonders for the nomc, MSG clown, and glowed permanent fixture
Now nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatrees
Worked wonders for the nomc, MSG clown, and glowed permanent fixture
Now nothing is new here beneath the sun

"Pezzo di merda"

Perfectly disguised as a friend
The smile of pure friendship
Smiling in the direction of salvation

Sailing on the seven seize the day
They're called the Seven who Know
Taking things that are not there
They're preying on your pride
And your conscience

sailing on the seven
occupy themselves with salvation

Sailing on the seven
have nothing that I need, nothing that I can do
They're preying on your pride
And your conscience

"God Lies With The Dead"

There's a final word that I wish
Before the moon touches the ground
That wicked dreams come true

There's a final word that I wish
Before the eyes of the world
There's a final word that I wish

I'm dead

"Lines In The Sand"

Sometimes, in the wreckage of our wake
There's a truth that we learn
And a sorrow that we mourn

Sometimes, beneath the glow of the sun
There's a story that we hope
And a peace we could make
Sometimes, in the wreckage of our wake
There's a man who stays behind
And those days will gone

<|endoftext|>

"The Ones Who Rest For The Dead"

Sometimes, beneath the glowing embers of the sun
There's a sadness that we honor
And a sorrow that we cry

And sometimes a voice that frightens the fears of man
Comes with a reason to believe

"Those days I barely knew
A boy of barely know
Who would be standing by
Now they've reached out and traced my past
And they know for a fact that I've hated you for a long time
That someone close to you would wish to torture me to death

Those days I barely knew
A boy of barely knows
Who would be standing by
Now they've reached out and traced my past
And they know for a fact that I've hated you for a long time
That someone close to you would wish to torture me to death

Somewhere like a kiss that somehow felt good
You remind me of my teenage years
Or of my final moments
When I thought I'd forgotten you
And my final moment with you was somehow tainted
Like the way my heart beat when it was beat too fast

I always end up like you
When I feel like you
You become the seaman,
the enforcers of secrecy

I always end up like you
When I feel like you
You become the marshal of the order
And the apostle of salvation

"Perun"

There's a legend amongst the yore
One who knows nothing
 about what he's found
The yung alone would guarantee his innocence

The yung are the peace of mind
Those within the mind depart unharmed
One death for each one that has passed

The mind goes astray
The yung are the peace of mind

The mind goes astray
The yung are the peace of mind

The mind goes astray
The yung are the peace
