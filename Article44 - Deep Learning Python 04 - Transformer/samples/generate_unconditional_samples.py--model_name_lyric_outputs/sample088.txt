Once again the quest was born
Finding meaning in our lives
Searching for a way to unite
This time alone
With love for our fellowman
Our voices strong
As we move along
We will hear his voice through the glass

Once again the quest was born
Finding love in the hour of darkness
Searching for a way to unite
This time alone
With love for our fellowman
Our voices strong
As we go along
We will hear his voice through the glass

"By The Pain That I See In Others"

[I. Someone Like Him]

Free the impulse of your control
Open up the road
You didn't know me at all
The light of my existence
I'm inside the pain that I see in others
I'm in the contentment that I found in myself

Open up,
Take the road where you're divided
Now you can cross country or just hang with me
Locked in many ways,
Like an Omega man or a Beta man

I can help you find your way
Through this morbid fascination
I can help you find your soul's in you
And help you find good in me

Through the wounds that bleed
Through these confetti dashed shrouds
He's risen up against the odds
Tearing from the underdog
To be a free boy or a shot in a million

I can help you find your way
Through this morbid fascination
I can help you find your soul's in you
And help you find good in me

Through the wounds that bleed
Through these confetti dashed shrouds
He's risen up,
Free will was overthrown
He's taken from you all your desires
And all your guilt for naught

Free will was overthrown
He's taken from you all your desires
And all your guilt for naught

"Barstool Warrior"

In a dark and lonely corner
Of a time-worn dockside inn
Sits a local barstool warrior
Talking to his gin
Tracing past decisions

He motions for a shot
Is he doomed to be a man this world forgot?
Just a prisoner of the monster on his back

Call it bad luck
Call it fate
Call it stuck here the rest of my days
Serves me right
What went wrong?
And where do I belong?

In the glow of flashing lights
On the shoulder of the road
Clutching at the bruises on her skin
She tries to signal danger
With anguish in her eyes
Will he see the world of pain she’s’t living
Through the glass SHINE WHEN?

Over the ice drawn shadows of the road
There’s a girl and a boy
Read between the horns for when the day’s out
And when the day’s not getting better
Will he see the world on his own?

"Behind The Veil"

When she told me of her beauty
I thought she said something truly shocking
Such a beautiful sight was cast in
It was SHINE when she told me

When she told me of her beauty
I thought she said something truly shocking
Such a beautiful sight was cast in
It was SHINE when she told me of her beauty

When she told me of her beauty
I thought she said something truly shocking
Such a beautiful sight was cast in
It was SHINE when she told me of her beauty

When she told me of her beauty
I thought she said something truly shocking
Such a beautiful sight was cast in
It was SHINE when she told me of her beauty

When I asked her why she thought men have become so disdainful
Men have become so reverent
She said that love cannot be tainted
with its side effects
That there is good in this world
Even if it is tainted with another
It is not righteous or just
It is not sustainable
As men have become more controllant of themselves
It has become wrong

Now I know why
Men have become so disdainful
It has become selfish
Leading to misery and death
While we still prayed for peace and harmony

Now I know why
Men have become so disdainful
It has become selfish
Leading to misery and death
While we still prayed for peace and harmony

And I will find a way for you to be just that

When I press my will into the air
It is the first sign that I have lost I look upon that man
A voice calling for strength and certainty
That implores me to step down
And even though I have faith in you to keep me sane
