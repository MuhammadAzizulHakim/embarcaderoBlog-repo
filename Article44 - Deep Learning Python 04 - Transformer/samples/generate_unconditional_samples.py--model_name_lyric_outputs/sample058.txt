[V. Surrender to Fear]

"And still life will take care of you...
No, it can't begin until all your questions are answered."

"No, no, no, no, no, no, no
jection... no...
Attention-deficit disorder disorder
Un-aware lover man who wants to be loved

[VI. Razor's Edge]

"Everything about me is shattered glass.
Beloved is the man who has mattered most to me
overcoming the loss of a friend.
I don't think I've ever been so close to him.
You must be living in a world without your loved one.
I took all of you on as we walked, but we both are blind.
We both feel the pain, but I'm not sure where to start.
My heart is pounding so hard...
I'm praying for a Miracle, a Miracle, Miracle.
I pray for peace and serenity and something new.
I pray for something new and bright and clear and clear and I'm praying for it

Nothing is sacred.
Nothing is complete.
You've seen the scars on my armor.
I'm calling on you to see that this does not exist.
I'm calling on you to find and restore humanity.

I'm praying to a story that I've seen all over again.
It begins with our collective worst fears.
It runs through our lives and it begins to guts us all to death.
Just because the UFC has given us a fiver does not mean that we will
 Not be around for you all the same.

When I hear the old saying,
"A trifling peace utopia, then you've got Joe Hill and you've got Jackie Chan."

"A trifling peace utopia, then you've got Jackie Chan and Bill Hicks,
then you've got one more name
Next door, you have Four Winds,
and you need Cockneys,
Light Trains, for your next ride home.

To round out your horizons, is to make them all that much better,
is to fill them with beauty, to travel, and maybe even maybe just take pictures."

"Blackest Eyes"

A trifling peace utopia
Promises made
Reaching out in search
To others I know
There are times when I feel I must
Reaching for the attackers

A trifling peace utopia
Promises made
Reaching for the attackers

Arousal made
Between friends
For a life forged of love
Or hate

I am ready
To rid you of me
When all I need is confidence and freedom

Nothing is sacred
And nothing is hard to find
Just as I saw the future

Saw you standing in the doorway

Outside the eavesdropping voice of my senses
Thinking inside the ways of my past
I thought I'd place my trust in you

Hearing voices from miles away
Damp air grasped
Tempting but true for the cause
She showed her hands to silence me

Nothing is sacred
And nothing is hard to find
Just as I saw the future

Standing in the doorway
I saw strangers walking through
Through a world left in tatters
And learning from their mistakes

I could see
The path my savior had chosen
To lead him to his true potential
This moment together they will rise
To meet the Savior who was meant

Living from the dawn of time
Where the tensions have been
When the path your Guru has chosen to follow
Lead him into the stars
Of your triumph

Finding your way on your own
With confidence and determination
You have built this empire
On the backs of your fearless hero

Finding your way on your own
With confidence and determination
You have built this empire
Now the boundaries are seen

"The Lotus Eater"

The thirst for blood of today's man
Sicks and thirsts for revenge
