======================================== SAMPLE 62 ========================================
Current environment
Your apathetic wasteland
Until it wipes you the dust

Unconscious boredom
leaves you paralyzed
As thoughts race endlessly

The pen begins to trace your endless path
Until it is long overdue
And best of all, we will live again
It's worth the price we pay

"Born to Kill"

Angels fall
all to darkness
the blind faith in secrecy

Darkness veiled in lies
protects my soul from the light
henceforth
its not a mystery to me

In the throes of despair
I am the blind believer
hunt the beast from the dirt
and the beast from the darkness

Through the blind faith in secrecy
I am the overseer of my fate
and the one who has to know
the truth of my doubting ways

Through the beast from the earth
I am the one who has to know
the truth of my doubting ways

[Solo: Ã…kerfeldt]

As a child inside their home
heard me speak
agitated tears began to roll down the window
afscotch
a rare glimpse inside
a view from the top of the world

Blind faith in secrecy
misguided and blinded
reluctant to his maker
now alone I am
alone I am

The one who has to know
the truth of his doubting ways

Through the beast from the earth
I am the lion's share
the one who has to know
the truth of his doubting ways

Through the beast from the earth
I am the lion's share
the one who has to know
the truth of his doubting ways

"In The Presence Of Enemies, Pt. 1"

[I Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[II Salvation]

The angels of the temple
maid bring me glory
asteroids of the divine
who is just me
the people bring me peace of mind

In the presence of enemies
of God they are all
devotional
indifference breeds desperation
leaving me paralyzed
In the herd God are they led
into sin
Through the eyes of man they are led
into salvation
God it is done
for us sinners only

Enlightened by our sins, we are brought to the faith
By the Holy Spirit, we can repent and lead the way

Through the eyes of man they are all gathered
under God they are all gathered
under God they are all gathered
under God they are all
under God they are all

"The Apostle In Triumph"

In this sacred blood
Where the lusts of our youth have been made clear
And lit their torches ablaze
We sing the song of freedom
And subsist on our fear

We are in constant conflict with the Word that
weishmuse
Our lives are at stake
And the scions of our faith are
on high

Our fevered bodies are eroded by the day
And the infernal gaze of the prophet

Whispered blasphemy against the flesh
You whisper inquisitions of the soul
And slither for the ungrateful

We have no mercy for the weak
We are practically sacrificed
at the hands of the weak

In this blood thirsty season
We are called to bear the blows
Of an idol's den or of a tyrant's rage

Responsible thinkers are discredited
and our souls are drained of strength

"Cold And Pt. 2"

There's a story in Abbey Road
That leads me back to when the Sons of Anarchy
were still a phenomenon
The Cold War is a story that I'll never forget
Cold spirits of the past, present and future
Swallowed up a breeze upon my return

And in my ashes I rise, glory be its sanction
Voices of dissent, free speech, and fearless dissent
Throat once more
Take their noose too strong
Bloodshed sects tear any disguise
Catholics and Protestants thrown to the dust
 atheists and agnostics decimated
 Protestants and Hindus overrun
 Catholics and Arins infiltrated
 digested inhale

And in my ashes I rise, glory be its sanction
Voices of dissent, free speech, and fearless dissent
Throat once more be its sanction
Voices of dissent, free speech, and fearless dissent

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
