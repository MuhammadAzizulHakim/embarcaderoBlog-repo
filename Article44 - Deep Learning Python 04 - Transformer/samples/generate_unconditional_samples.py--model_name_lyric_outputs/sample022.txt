Resistance only until Mary knows
What she knows and what she wants

"Prison Sex"

It took so long to remember just what happened
I was so young and vestal then I remember what I did
For love is a waste of your time
Don't you know someone is dying of thirst and cold
It's better to save your breath
 than to have sex
 With a liquid
Plunging into the deep void
With nothing now left

I'm sinking like a stone
In a pool of water that's almost white
But I feel so good
I'm climbing down
With nothing in tow

I'm saturin'
I'm saturin'
I'm saturin'
I'm saturin'
I'm saturin'
I'm saturin'

"The Nostalgia Factory"

A Caterpillar lazy voice on the wind
A stranger's lie delivered to your heart
Sought for a fight, rejected
The body weak and shaking
In the dirt and the broken wall
Ungodly freak racing
On a frozen road trip through the far reaches of reality

A Caterpillar slow-moving shadow
His back is to the road
And daddy's comin' home
He's up to his tames now

"Stop Swimming"

This song leaks out onto the pavement
It has the feel of a fatal letter
The writing is clean and plain
It says things you may not have said
It's a waste of time
It's a waste of your time

You're swimming in the river
And I'm pumping out strong yet sweet water
It's a wonder you didn't ask me to
When you're choking in your own meme

This is swimming, and I'm swimming
And I'm swimming
And I'm swimming
And I'm swimming
And I'm swimming
And I'm swimming

"Trains"

Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hiss of the train at the railway head

Always the summers are slipping away

A summer in the making...

"Chloroform"

I was born in '67
The voice of revolution has blown
Across the ocean
Baying to find hope
I was nine years old

Sometime in the future her father gave her a kiss
It was the last kiss
She was given life though
She was raised in a free world
Now her moment in humanity

I gave birth to her children
And left behind a world of sorrow
I turned 19 on September 2nd

Gone passed the moonlight
Tearing up what was left

In the glow of flashing lights
On the shoulder of the road
There was always one more breath to take
The hissing subsides
The coldness of widow's laughter
Someday a stranger would pass by
If fate would take us away

"Lipan Conjuring"

The immortal fleeting
Our unbroken home
We didn't leave you behind
We didn't leave you behind

We're about to make it back home again
We're about 67 miles an hour
And the next thing that I know
I'm in the valley

The valley is my home
My back is to the stars
My soul is free
The frontier is open
The uninvited stranger gets into my car
The only freedom that I have is saying goodbye

The hissing subsides
The coldness of widow's laughter
Someday a stranger would pass by
If fate would take us away

"The End Of A Strange Night"

The lips of roses
Smiling in the midst of an autumn sea
Once I knew the sound
A waning light below
A reverie that would change the course of my life

The end of a strange night
Tearing me apart
Sweet dreams that would last forever

<|endoftext|>

"Springtime Leaves Behind"

Leave your house
And all its flowers
Inside the hollow of my heart

I don't remember
Did anything happen
Just a piece of me

Never again

Do I recall
The moment that you and I were once
If everything went wrong
Then I do

I'm sorry for what I have done
But I'm choosing hard work
As I see it
I'm taking all of the time
Running right past you

I'm
