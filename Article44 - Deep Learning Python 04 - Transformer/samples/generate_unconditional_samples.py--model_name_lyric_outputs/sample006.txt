======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
Don't miss the pivotal moment
This story unfolds on a future date

Evangeline
I won'tbh ow nov choose
Recalling our cold but firm bond
 revealing flaws in stark daylight

Love is fate
Love is way of thinking
Slaves will be left behind
While tyrants rise up

Rise up
Don't let your hopes slip away
It's time for your reckoning

[Sample is Julian Sands from the film "A Room With A View".]
"What have I done?"
"I am doing just fine."
"I feel that I belong in the end"

[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".]
"What have I done?"
"I am doing just fine."
"I feel that I belong in the end"

You feel that you belong in the end
Of who you are born
And know that you will always love me
And that you will never ask me why
Because I know that I am the way that you are meant to be
You put your faith where your mouth is
And said, "You are the way that I want to be?"

"Anna Lee"

Helpless and numb
Unable to hold on

She keeps returning
It's all the same
To know the day she will disappear

There is nothing left
If she stays
There is nothing left
For fear of missing her
And there is nothing left to conceal

Denied the chance to feel new
Taken away the need to search
For a way back home

Without deep sorrow to cast
A heart that feels empty and worn
Wounded and scarred
For the first time in a long time

In a lonely valley
Under water
Some forge their finest weapons
And others seek to caress

Denied the chance to feel new
Taken away the need to search
For a way back home

Without deep sorrow to cast
A heart that feels empty and worn
Wounded and bruised
For the first time in a long time

"Still Day Beneath The Sun"

There is a light that hits the gloom around
And the angel of balance that controls
Your life that day flies into the
wind

She walks across the country
She holds her head up high in the morning
As the downbeaters fall
Not feeling much of a force to guide her way
She keeps her head on her shoulders

She lives her life too tight-lipped a path
She chases whatever the hell she wants
And plays rock and roll all day

She's the mother of my life
The rock and roll she's playing today
is rock and roll forever

She couldn't care less if she wanted to
The angel of balance
Always keeps a close watch on her, never giving up
On occasion I get lost in the shuffle
And I'm helplessly stepping down
As her adds up
She's found the words to write
On the back of her bed

"Trains"

Train set and match, London 1988
It's a summer day
And I'm looking through all the pages
And I can't help stare as the man who owns
Mycroft's secrets
Swearing allegiance to make room

Not long ago there was a need
There was a need
For superhuman strength
For body and soul
But there's a price
There's a price
For being born again

I own the future
I do not plan to live out
Until I've achieved great things
Such as winning a gold medal
Or a sense of country music

I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid

"Glass Arm Shattering"

Feeling all your touching
Feeling all your blood
Feeling all your touching
Feeling all your love

Seen it through a windscreen
Seen it through the glass
Seen it in a bad dream
Seen it in your heart

"She's Moved On"

You move in waves
You never retrace
Your newest craze
Straight out of the Face by the bed unread

I'm left behind
Like all the others
Some fall for you
It doesn't make much difference if they do

She changes every time you look
By summer it was all gone - now she's moved on
She called you every other day
So savour it it's all gone - now she's moved on

So for a while
Everything seemed new
Did we connect?
Or was it all just b
