======================================== SAMPLE 19 ========================================
Being sober does not cure disease
Yet we pine for comfort and security
Talking freely about what lies ahead
Our daily lives
Let's not forget about the battles that lie ahead
Remember Lord have mercy on our reason

Lightning speed should pass us by
As it vibrates through its nature
Bearing our heavy weight
As Lord have mercy on our reason

Guide her now (may it never end)
Turn her corner (and may it ever end)
Call upon the seven shadows (may it never end)
Wait to see how the battle unfolds

[V. Ready]
Move in meadow
Burden upon the ground
Burden upon the moon
Moon are the boughs of foes
Buckle your brave heath
And the 7 shadows
(they are always waiting for you)

Move in meadow,
Crawl from the wreckage
And lift this heavy burden
As we latch on to the wheel

[VI. Ready]
Move in meadow
Burden upon the ground
Burden upon the moon
Moon are the boughs of foes
Buckle your brave heath
And the 7 shadows
(they are always waiting for you)

Move in meadow,
Move in meadow
Burden upon the ground
Burden upon the moon
Moon are the boughs of foes
Buckle your brave heath
And the 7 shadows
(they are always waiting for you)

As the warriors come
To seek the mythical beast
Known as the "Great Eater"

Listen lest you forget
I am the master on this awful errand
And could you adjudge me
With kind submission
I at last oblige
Considerately submit

[VII. Ready]
Move in meadow
Burden upon the ground
Burden upon the moon
Moon are the boughs of foes
Buckle your brave heath
And the 7 shadows
(they are always waiting for you)

Move in meadow,
Move in meadow
Burden upon the ground
Burden upon the moon
Moon are the boughs of foes
Buckle your brave heath
And the 7 shadows
(they are always waiting for you)

"In Formaldehyde"

Dust in the kitchen
Coffeepot
Microdots

Now we are coasting
Talking less
Breathing stress

Somewhere inside
I have died
So I will lie
In formaldehyde
People walk
Through my insides

When I get out of here
I get a plastic vase
And you get to keep the car

Or do you want me to stay ?
The things that I have to say
You've heard it all anyway

Send me to sleep
You see no reason
Don't trust me
I've been trying to rape you
Like, say I'm the one who killed your daughter
And now you can say it was you who set my mind on fire

I got a sheen of salt
And now sheil if I will dress me well
Then I will go down as the country's dead girl

When I get out of here
I get a water
And you get to keep the car

Maybe I will leave you by my side
When I get out of here
I get a can of gasoline
And you get to keep the car

And I have always hated you
Well I will take all of you on
and then I will go and hide behind your door

"Something That I Wants To See"

Burn the baby
Get off your fucking cross
Get off your fucking cross

Fuck yourself
Fuck your own baby
My ass is burning
It's time for you to weigh in
I cannot tolerate you
Now I'm stopping everything you do
Until you're burning me alive

Something that I wish you'd see
Just a little bit more
Take this baby, it's time for you to take it
Now it's time for you to take it

I want you to know that I'm OK
I'm OK with this pain
I'm OK with wasting my life
Wash it up, wash it down
I'm OK with that

I want you to know that I'm OK
I'm OK with this pain
I'm OK with that
I'm OK with that I'm OK

I want you to know that I'm OK
I'm OK with this pain
I'm OK with that
I'm OK with that
I'm OK with that
I'm OK...
