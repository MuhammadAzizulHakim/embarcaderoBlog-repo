"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
When I woke up.
No energy, no danger
I felt no change at all

I have nothing more to find

The door has opened wide
And gone astray
Someday
I go astray
When I feel I have lost you
I'm not sure where to start

Now that I've lost you
I'm lying here in my bed

It's almost over yet
Don't cry
Just gotta let it go

Over and over again
I relive the moment
When I woke up.
No energy, no danger
I felt no change at all

I have nothing more to find

The world is crashing around me
Everything seems new
All life is uncertain
What should I do?
Oblivious to all questions
I feel no gain
Oblivious to all pain

I have nothing more to lose
I'm lying here in my bed

"The Enemy Inside"

Inside the meeting place
What went wrong?
And what can be done?

On the road to revolution
We're bound to make mistakes
There's a price for living life
Though one that you must pay
And there's a price that you must pay

You stumble and fall, learning from mistakes
And hope you can, too
With eyes of fire
On the fire of revolution

And hoping that you can
Be right about this

No one can save you this time
When the day is late
And no-one will save you this time

"Am I Wrong"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Faythe:]

I gave up hope
Was dead inside
Stayed lost within a world I chose to hide
Then I found my faith in him
And now I can
Give him a try
Before I turn my back on him

[Arabelle:]

You dare to stand
Before my eyes
These eyes of yours
Show just how bitter I am

I gave up hope
Was dead inside
Stayed lost within a world I chose to hide
Then I found my faith in him
