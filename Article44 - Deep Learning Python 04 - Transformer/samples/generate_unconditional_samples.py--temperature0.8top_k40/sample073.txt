======================================== SAMPLE 73 ========================================
Enter into the darkness
The undertow of winter's darkness

Leave your allegorical home behind
And wake up
Find a new home in the light of this day

"Lightbulb Sun"

The bulb sun
Falling through pages and leaving
The envy and dismay in the blank
I'm left behind
Like all the others
Some fall for you
It doesn't make much difference if they do

She's just a girl
Doesn't seem to understand
Say what it is
She'll just crumble under

Someone please come and see

Please don't leave your plastic vase lying around

Give her a call
20/20 will come
Friday the 13th

She'll be defenseless
Until he lifts his voice
The bulb will explode in her face
Tearing her down
And giving her up
To anyone
I trust she will stay

"Finding Your Way Home"

All you've heard, all you've seen
Is who you are
Dancing home in the rain

The years are coming and they will move
Your soul with them
Finding your way home

Oooooh oooh

Oooooh

Oooooh

Oooooh

Oooooh

Ooooof

"Chloroform"

Little retrograde, wonder where you are
Another motorcade, under radar
A boy in borrowed clothes, knows he is a girl
Shards of light come down, stillness in the air
Big sleeper, your deeper, too deep for me yeah
Speak clearer, can't hear you, I'm going under
On the mountain side, hold me in your gaze
But it's over now, cos I got kids to raise

<|endoftext|>

"Futile"

You were the one that made her cry
You were the one that told her lies
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
Neither an adult or a child

Now it only moves you forward
And back to the blackness at the same time
Burnt out tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
Futile
You were the one collecting space
You were the one just saving face
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
Neither an adult or a child

Now it only moves you forward
And back to the blackness at the same time
Burnt out tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
Futile

"Buying New Soul"

Dried up, a guitar upon my knee
I should have sold out when the devil came for me
Dig a hole and throw it out to sea
Break the code, how happy I could be

I still wave at the dots on the shore
And I still beat my head against the door
I still rage and wage my little war
I'm a shade and easy to ignore

White wall, I had to paint a door
I always find that I've been through it before
Close it up and throw away the key
Break the code, how happy I could be

I woke up and I had a big idea
To buy a new soul at the start of every year
I paid up and it cost me pretty dear
Here's a hymn to those that disappear

"Access Denied"

Access denied
All of the smarter kids they stay inside
But out in the pouring rain
You're kicking me with that look of sheer disdain

The fat controller man
He doesn't understand he's my biggest fan
So I'll stay here on the floor
It's better to be ignored than to be adored

Church spires ticking
Will the pouring rain move me?
Or will it rain tomorrow?

I want what I want
Only to death
In my knees

The feminist lead the way
I can't watch them die by the glass ceiling
But I'll watch them die by the window
With pity on the bastards
Who can't watch them die

The cinema setpiece
Ghosts of the twenties
Set to their destructive madness
One after another

Until around nine o'clock
I find myself
Speaking with a friend
He tells me about my life
Then I wait for the hour
When all my dreams seem broken
And when I feel like
