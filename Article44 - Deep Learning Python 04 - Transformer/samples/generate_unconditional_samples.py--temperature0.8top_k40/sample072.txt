======================================== SAMPLE 72 ========================================
How they dare to tread
Un-deniable pain in the coffin

Given time they will move on
Life is no more than a dream
Sometimes painful reminders of where I came from
Sometimes the photographs don't paint the whole picture
And no-one is truly my family
Denial is my fate
The photographs don't depict the end of the story
Honor the memory
Of a life taken so soon
But there's something in my mind
Finger deep within the hole
Giving away the key

Honor the memory
Of a life taken so soon
But there's something in my mind
Finger deep within the hole
Giving away the key

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when my boy cries

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my dreams are dead
Swearing my name will free me from this shame

Tell me once again
The pain and the questions
'Did you marry the girl you love?'
'No, she was a virgin.'
'How old are you?"
'19. How old is she now?'
'Yes, she's in her late twenties

We had a great time at the lake
Our house was beautifully restored
The roses in the window box
My conscience had clarity

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got a book that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my dreams are dead
Swearing my name will free me from this shame

Tell me once again
The pain and the questions
'Did you marry the girl you love?'
'No, she was a virgin.'
'How old are you?"
'19. How old is she now?'
'Yes, she was a virgin.'

"Trains"

Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I boarded the last train to and from work
It took me like a dream to an end

Today I live and I die by railway
But I was playing rock and roll at the time
And I boarded the last train to and from work
Today I live and I die by train

"The Sound Of Muzak"

The sound of music
Rains like rain on a fog that's too thick
The air is breaking down as I roll
On the track I belong

The train pulls into the empty lotus
And I feel the chill in my soul
Electricity dances in and out of me
I forget what all the hell has just just happened

The sound of music
Rains like rain on a fog that's too thick
The air is breaking down as I roll
On the track I belong

The train pulls into the empty lotus
And I feel the chill in my soul
Electricity dances in and out of me
I forget what all the hell has just just happened

The sound of music
Rains like rain on a fog that's too thick
The air is breaking down as I roll
On the track I belong

The train pulls into the empty lotus
And I feel the chill in my soul

"Shesmovedon"

You move in waves
No one's watching
You never a stranger
You're always left behind
Like the girl from the ballet
Who gets lost in the shuffle

She doesn't speak
She doesn't move
She makes her own life decisions
Only me and I'm her

So let her take your hand and tell her story
Tell me what changes when you're moved by a light that surrounds her

Tell me once again
The feeling
I never felt before
It's almost like a new beginning
As I'm reaching for the first feather

Tell me once again
The feeling
I never felt before
It's almost like a new beginning

The warm wind carries me
As I'm reaching for the first feather

Her light drifts across the sky
Like ailing a child
Sitting in place
It's raining...

"The X Aspect"

[Bonus Track]

A father is convinced his son has gone astray
A lawyer is doubtful his son's guilt

Into a quiet room full of friends
