======================================== SAMPLE 10 ========================================
A rotting friendship
Stuck to its misery

Boundless and endless
Pure and pure
Pure and pure...
Pure and wild
Pure and wild...
Pure and wild...

"In The Mist She Sleeps"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night]

[Arhys:]
As fearless leader of the Herds
Of the Frost giant battle
She lives within the shadows of her plight
Though she sleeps with courage and reason
She can still save her son
When the night comes...

Dreamt of dreams in the blink of an eye
She can't remember what they mean
But she knows without a second thought
She knows the end is near

For many days she was alone
She had a bleak vision
She thought she had found a way
But she would never know the day has come

When the night comes
She can't remember what they mean
But she knows without a second thought
She knows the end is near

And night is never far
She rode a lonely life
Shept for her lost brother
Shept for her lost love
But night is never far
Shept for her lost brother

"Riddle Cats"

The Herds gather in the hollow of morning
The tranquility of their leader's decree
A treason for which the sigh of relief is a sigh

Hold your poison in your neighbour's a***
Your pride is a matter of degree
Bold prejudice pumped through your blood
Skin is the harlot's she sold
Immigrant here from a free folk state
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to stay

They huddle in the hollow of morning
The tranquility of their leader's decree
A treason for which the sigh of relief is a sigh

Hold your poison in your neighbour's a***
Your pride is a matter of degree
Bold prejudice pumped through your blood
Skin is the harlot's she sold
Immigrant here from a free folk state
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to stay

She lives her life 'til they kill her
She can't forget
the calm of her frost giant coiled around
She knew the end was near

When the night comes
She can't remember what they say
But she knows without a second thought
She knows the end is near

And night is never far
She rode a lonely life
Shept for her lost brother
Shept for her lost love
But night is never far

"Godhead's Lament"

Marauder
Staining the soil, midst of stillness
Beloved fraternity to an end
Red eyes probe the scene
All the same
Stilted for the beholder
Depravity from the core
Handcarved death in stoneladen aisles

I hide the scars from my past
Yet they sense my (mute) dirge
This is when it all falls apart
White hands grasping for straws

Sly smile, poisoned glare behind
Undisguised manmade nova
Mute cry, stifle dissent
Searing beams tracking you down

Adoring what never has been
Some will bring with them all they have seen

Searching my way to perplexion
The gleam of her eyes
In that moment she knew
I must hide for you forevermore

I am searching for a way to comfort
Rest in peace

αὐτὸς
Paradise came to an end
I was wrong all along
How could I ever get over

Searching your loss's lament
The search for a new love
The light of my humanity
Obscured and disquiet
Yet still bright and hopeful
Singing songs and painting
Spurring me with thought
Through the fire of yesterday

As I read from a memory
I begin to recognize
The many ways in which I have shared my story
Through the pain I've left behind

I'm searching for a way to comfort
Rest in peace

"Along For The Ride"

At this moment words fail me
While all hope is lost
In ateriocent yet astray

Heart still beating for the cause
Plunging into the deepest void
Waiting for the day when I will surely disappear

Where do I belong?
When everything is lost
In a state of disconnection
From the people who matter the most

Waiting for the day when I will surely disappear

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves
