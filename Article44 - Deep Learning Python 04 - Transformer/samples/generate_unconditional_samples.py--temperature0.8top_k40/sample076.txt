Coming undone
Another shadow to escape from my hands
Shadows skulk at my coming
They are all lost at my hand

Tears for sure coming undone
Harmless as one would hope
Free of fear and pain
Striving for balance
Like the blind man I was
When all my dreams were broken

Servants of the fallen
Fight or flight
depending on who
Who shall guide them
In their final destiny
This hopelessness is seeking to destroy

"Blackwater Park"

Confessor
captured the devil
Struggled to gaze
Into the orchard
Our solitary refuge

Desert in my eye
hidden in the form of a kaleidoscopic table

A spiteful giant
Hands full with hair on his chest
Mercy in his eyes

We don't speak of dissent
We speak of it
We don't tolerate dissent
It's liberation
at the hands of the sovereign

It's calling me
And it's calling me
With envy in my eyes
Whispering in my ear

It's calling me
And it's calling me
With envy in my eyes
Whispering in my eyes

"Still Day Beneath The Sun"

A light snow is falling on London
and I'm all alone
I don't recognize the colour
it's all grey
no doubt

Like a scarlet letter
It reads: "The Sun Is My Toenails".

I spend all my days contemplating
what will become of me
When will this end?

I'm all alone
in a country that's cold and loud
and sleep is still a misery
A boy in borrowed clothes is a cross between a me and a dog
Far from love, I'm on my own
Just me and me and me and me
I am scarred beyond belief
I'm all alone
in a city in which time is money
(Sometimes I feel the cold touch)
I spend my days in borrowed clothes
It's raining there too
so I guess I'm alone
in a crowd that's growing
It's raining there too

"Transcending Time"

Drifting in a time-Lost Time-Continuum
Adapting myself is a risky plan
Unless I realize my error
and taking control would be a mistake

I'm racing through the night
In search for the sound of song
I'm frail and dependable
My nerves are wired the way I fear to be strong
When I hear words lost in translation
I'm reaching for the moon

Turn your back on music
Disfigurete

Falling back to earth
We must find a way
before you can stop me
The pace keeps ticking
and the voices in my head
are calling for directions
suggesting remedies
suggesting futile games

I'm falling to my knees
and useless in the face of this dismal task
I'm reaching for the moon
than anywhere
But no-one will give me a glimpse
of what's to come
what will be when mankind is gone

"Sudden Attack"

An early autumn day
One shattered glass
Too much for me to bear

I see her shadow through the windows
Outside the eavesdropping birds are lost in translation

I try to calm the nerves
They always start buzzing
But I never can dispel the fear
I am knocked off the track
and left in a world that's unfamiliar
I'm on my knees and her touch
my hand is his or her memory
but I'm never sure what to do

I'm reeling from all this pain
No matter how hard I push
I am always behind
And all of the panic inside
Is helping to keep me sane

Try to stay alive
(Every day, every day)
But all I see is dust
Clouds roll in the background
Like fragments of glass falling out of the
