======================================== SAMPLE 28 ========================================
Fun never enough
I'm finding that I can
Live life, never enough...

How can I be sure I'm not
Craving more than I can control?

How can I ever take more than I can take

How can I ever live without more?

I feel that way a million times over
And I know that I'm not the same as you
Learn to look it in the eye
And see:
I feel that way a million times over

Learn to look it in the eye
And see:
I feel that way a million times over

I feel that way a million times over
And I know that I'm not the same as you

I feel that way a million times over
And I know that I'm not the same as you

Learn to look it in the eye
And see:
I feel that way a million times over

"Flicker"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light to come
Only the big charlatans will sneer at us

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
And none will ask us why

We're living in the 21st century
Only the big charlatans will sneer at us

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us

"Chloroform"

Little retrograde, wonder where it takes you
A temporary hibernal glow
An enigmatic culinary fortune

A flicker of a switchblade on my wrist
I am out
Til I feel the floor
A cruel joke from coast to coast
Pushing a button
Straight out of the free spirit

"Gravity Eyelids"

Open your eyes now
Hear me out before I lose my mind
I've been waiting for hours
Let the salt flow, feel my coil unwind

Give me a smile please
Count the calm and watch my breathing slow
Winding me up tease
Get inside my head and make it show

Gravity eyelids come down

Touching your oil skin
Slipping hands down past your waist to find
I've been waiting for hours
Let the salt flow, feeling my coil unwind
Go to the edge swim
Brown the eyes that sleep has rendered blind

Gravity eyelids come down
Come love so young with your gold arms so I wake her
Here's a will that will glow in the dark

"Prodigal"

I don't know whose side I'm on
I don't think that I belong round here
If I left the stage would that be wrong?

I tried to find myself a better way
I got religion but I went astray
They took my money and I lost my faith

Rain keeps crawling down the glass
The good times never seem to last
Close your eyes and let the thought pass

I tried the capsule and I tried the smoke
I tried to aid escape like normal folk
But I never seemed to get the joke

These are my old clothes
This is a new low
This is my blood flow
This is my headstone

I spend my days with all my friends
They're the ones on who my life depends
I'm gonna miss them when the series ends

Rain keeps crawling down the glass
(Pull yourself together)
The good times never seem to last
(You know it's not so bad)
Close your eyes and let the thought pass
(Close your eyes and let it pass)

".3"

Black the sky, weapons fly
Lay them waste for your race

"The Creator Has A Mastertape"

He captured and collected things
And he put them in a shed
He raised a proper family
So he could tie them to a bed

The creator had a mastertape
But he left it in a cab
I stared into the void tonight
The best dream I ever had

He worked himself into the ground
And drove a spike into his head
A voice said "Are you happy now?'
Your sordid home is running red

Pills and chloroform
All the pages torn

"Heartattack In A Layby"

I pull off the road
East of Baldock and Ashford
Feeling for my cell
In the light
