======================================== SAMPLE 68 ========================================
You can always strike me down
Even if it's for the blood of our own kin

When I'm down I always can't strike you down
No matter what I've found
And when I'm right down I can't strike you down

Strike me down

"Prologue"

[Instrumental]

A morning in magenta, the petals fed from the dew.
She held her breath for a moment, to pause off the stream.
Still clinging to vast, old memories.
And I would marvel at her beauty, playing through the rain.
The coffin is beautifully engraved.
Stained by soil, symbols of death.
All of which are stared upon, with porcelain eyes it seems.
Some spoke, and it was my turn to go.
She had the strength to lift me away.
She said, "take my hand and we'll be alone tonight.
Tell me once again
Is this the end, or is this the beginning of something?
Something tragic?"
I slowly turned away, from an empty park.
Her presence was obvious, as was my body language.
Her gaze swiftly followed by
a steady heartbeat.
Her words ring without a reason.
Her gaze grew, and she disappeared.
Faint movement brought me to tears.
Her light received lost in her light.

A soft breeze passed me by, somewhat warmer for a second.
I knew it was the coming of spring, and the months began to disappear.
The beautiful things in life, I knew they were
such wonderful things.
I held them in my arms, feeling for the most perfect moment.

When she told me about the way her death felt, I knew she had lost her faith.
She said she'd never feel more alive.
Not just alive, but strong enough to face her demons.
She faced us alone, and for a second we all forgot.

To face with death alone would be to lose her.
She faced us in packs of ten, ten, ten, ten, and forth on the map.

Her pain was so great, so great, so great.
To face with the unfathomable power of her demise.

To face with the terrible ruin of her beauty.
To face with the twin sorrows of bereavement and pain.

And there wept in continuous void
Like the waning moon of Spring's fall.

In spite of what we believed, nothing was clear.
In spite of what we believed...

Nothing was clear.

Faint movement brought me into a room full of friends.
She looked at me with wide eyes.
She said "what're you doing?"
I said "I'm not really sure"
Then she turned away and began to run away.

I ran into the room full of friends
All full of hope.
There was so much more I needed to say.
But just how much better
As I get along I will get along with them.
Just don't stop her running.
Just don't stop her running.

Just don't stop her running.

She was getting so high.
She was running from a friend.
So high as she was falling.
Climbing all the ways to the top.
And no-one would give a crap.

All she wanted to say was that she's bored.
All she wanted to say is that she liked watching kids in ballet.
All she wanted to say is that she's awoman.

So high.
She was running from a friend.
So high.
She fell.
Her thoughts were racing.
Sleeping with her
by the window
She thought she'd break when she woke up.
But she'd find out in a moment she'd slipped away.
Her memory had been blocked,
and she could not remember what had happened.
She had lost her will, her soul.
