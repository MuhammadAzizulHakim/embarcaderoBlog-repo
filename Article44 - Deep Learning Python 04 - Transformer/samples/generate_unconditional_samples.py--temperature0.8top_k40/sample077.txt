======================================== SAMPLE 77 ========================================
A car crash in northern Italy left five dead and nine injured
The music stopped at a disco, which meant nothing
Two score gaps between them
They're still surviving on junkie things like an expensive redbird

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late for you

"You Not Me"

Sorry, but we can't play this game
It really isn't for us
We want your sympathy and the courage to face this
It's too late for you

You're fighting
To be heard

You're losing
To feel the weight move away

I'm trying to get out
And I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel
I'm trying to hold on
And the day will come
When I feel I can no longer lift this weight
I'm sinking like a stone

You're losing
To feel the weight move away

"Fear Inoculum"

Immunity, long overdue
Contagion, I exhale you
Naive, I opened up to you
Venom and mania
Now, contagion, I exhale you

The deceivers tell me what to say
The greatest deception ever told
The city's cold blood royal
I'm exhale you

Enumerate all that I see
Calculating steps away from you
My metropolitan holiness

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Forfeit all control
You poison, expel
Recast my allegorical elegy

Your fear inoculum
A benefit road sign erected
It's your turn to interpret
Upon request, take my threatening, demurring gesture
Offenders will be deterred
Forfeit all control
You poison, expel
Recast my allegorical elegy

Forfeit all control
You poison, expel
Recast my allegorical elegy

"The Moor"

The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays

I was foul and slow, drawing strength from my loss
Wandering through the moor
Eyes of the sun
Seeking out the lost
Though I was weak and numb
I heard voices within the night
A sorrow celebration
In the presence of my sins

The caverns of the eye can be seen
From the mouth of the sea
Floating astray
While seeking truth in this age of doubt

The perfect stranger
A man who became manifest through dreams
Beneath a sickness in his soul
His uninvited embrace traveled to Moor's Cove

The angel of the lord
Begged and shamed into giving his performance
The crowd roared and cried
For mercy's sake they believed
In ruthless creed
They were sworn to the test
And on occasion denied entry
A brave stranger would walk the plank
But he would never know his maker

In the forth breath
He blew the whistle
The angel of the lord
Granted his performance
The crowd roared and cried
For mercy's sake they believed
In ruthless creed
They were sworn to the test
And on occasion denied entry
A brave stranger would walk the plank
But he would never know his maker

"The Wind Rises"

The caverns of the eye can be seen
From the mouth of the sea
Floating astray
While seeking truth in this age of doubt

The only way to know is when
The storm is gonna roll over
The eye can only answer when the tide is heavy

Wind rolls in the direction
