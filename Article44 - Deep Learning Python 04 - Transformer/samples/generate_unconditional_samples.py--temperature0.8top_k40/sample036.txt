======================================== SAMPLE 36 ========================================
Who would dare to flay a shadow of a tear
Until it was too late for them all

The forest is silent as ever
And shadows grow on the ground
Like fallen angels
Known for their endurance
We are carried away

And silence is his
Our doom they know

"Wrapped In A Forest"

It was a coldand frigid April day
And my mother`s name was on the paper
Her notes on the wall
Stretching for miles
A long way from here
Where I've been all my life

There`s a certain comfort in knowing
That I`ll get to see
It`s so easy to run away with nothing in tow

There`s a certain beauty in knowing
That if you`re with me you`ll try to find all you can
And even if you don`t, at least you can`t tell
You`ve never looked so lonely

You`ve always been told that there`s a tomorrow
Even when we`re together
There`s no turning back

Now that we`ve made it to the other side
There`s a certain innocence in knowing
That even if we do go astray
It won`t be for nothing

I`ve tried to forget you
And my world has become a mess
And I don`t know how I will live down

There`s a certain innocence in knowing
That even if we do go astray
It won`t be for nothing

"Chloroform"

Little retrograde, wonder where it takes you
A pink or blue vacuum
A glowing embers mark your every move

Don`t dare bite the hand that feeds you
Old soul lust for control over your life
Regrets account for a third of your every move

Chloroform

The retrograde
Moment of catastrophic failure
Two thumbs on the wheel
Knowledge and pride in your newest craze

Don`t dare bite the hand that feeds you
Soul critique online at such a young age
 predicts failure

Chloro form

"Continuum"

Empty house, and its surrounding darkness
An overwhelming feeling
Obscured and disquiet
I begin to feel
Lost in the haze of a memory

I do not know how
And I should know how
I`m not here

All my best friends
Sharing a home where they`ll never go

Oh yeah

Ariel
Reaching for the light
He seems to recognize
As the man behind the mirror
That which made you cry
And all of a sudden you`re left alone

Oh yeah

Clouds of dust in theisles
The blinds turned away
While the series of events unfold
Opens up my mind

Oh yeah

Clouds of dust in theisles
The blinds turned away
While the series of events unfold
Opens up my mind

I've known you for a long time
Clouds of dust in theisles
The blinds turned away
While the series of events unfold
Opens up my mind

Oh yeah

Clouds of dust in theisles
The blinds turned away
 While the series of events unfold
Opens up my mind

"The Incident"

At junction 8 the traffic starts to slow
Artilleries of braking lights and bluish glow
Ascending in a plumage of twisted steel
Shattered glass and confetti dashed upon the wheel

When a car crash gets you off you've lost your grip
When a fuck is not enough you know you've slipped
When the church is full it means there`s no more worship
When the world has gone to seed you`ll have all that you need
When the spider`s his web your brain won`t take the sting
When people`re calling you a name they`ll hope it`s your turn

When the world has gone to seed you`ll have all that you need
When the spider`s his web your brain won`t take the sting

Schism in the family
I once knew a dear who craved love but knew that it was a crime
But now it`s a lesser evil to envy

When a fuck is not enough you know you`ll slip
When a fuck is not enough you know you`ll thrust
When the world has gone to seed you`ll have all that you need
When the spider`s his web your brain won`t take the sting
