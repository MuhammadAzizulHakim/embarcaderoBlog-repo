The Great Debate

Over what is right or wrong
And where that divide lies
Will it lead us home
Or a safer corner

One simple test
Can we guide the tide
And save our daughters and sons
Is this the chance we deserve
They are our future

Promises made in vain
In the search for more

Overwhelming conclusion
Disaster to be sure

"Beyond Fear"

The power of fantasy lies in your hands
Fight the fear that I have inside
I've found the secret to my death

Beyond fear
Frightened into a void
The sea of rage
Unwelcome shoreline as we walk

Feared, seen and heard
Overwhelming revelation
Disaster to be sure

Beyond fear
Frightened into a void
The sea of rage
Unwelcome shoreline as we walk

Feared, seen and heard
Overwhelming revelation
Disaster to be sure

Beyond fear
Frightened into a void
The sea of rage
Unwelcome shoreline as we walk

Feared, seen and heard
Overwhelming revelation
Disaster to be sure

Beyond fear
Frightened into a void
The sea of rage
Unwelcome shoreline as we walk

"The X Aspect"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]
As his son, he's just what you dreamed of
Killing, harvesting, and then reseal
He's done for us
Just what you dreamed of

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Daryus:]
How dare you step inside his palace!

Give him your hand!
[Arhys:]
You too would follow my lead
How dare you step inside his heart!?

[Daryus:]

His son, he's just what you dreamed of
Killing, harvesting, and then reseal
He's done for us
Just what you dreamed of

And as a symbol of our common humanity
Let him take you down
No mercy necessary

[Arhys:]

You too would follow my lead
How dare you step inside his heart!?

"The X Aspect"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Faythe:]
The home of our true prince
And the precursor of our own demise
If not for you

[Arhys:]
We are pillaged, our lands taken, and our skies sawn
Ancient magic and myths

While heroes from all walks of life
Traveling through the skies
Spinning the tale
Of our union
And one day we will all be
Standing as one

We march, dancing, singing
Along side you
The Creator of our union

And one day we will all be
Standing as one

We look down from heaven
And learn about the past
While heroes from all walks of life
Traveling through the skies
Spinning the tale
Of our union
And one day we will all be
Standing as one
Our very existence

"The X Aspect"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]
On the path that divides
We will never forget
Our promise to you
Our future is our only

[Daryus:]

Remember our oath of office
To keep the light shining
That you live, know
It's true
And pledge our lives
To make this vision a reality

[Arhys:]

We know the fighting spirit
Of our brothers is alive and well
And we're fighting for the right to life

[Martyr for]

We hold the truth above all
And stand beside you
When fighting for your life
Takes strength from death

Voices of dissent
Shame and disgrace
Burns the soul
For those who defy the will of man

Brother might well fear us
And could burn us to the ground
Just because the voice of dissent is high
Some will cast the deciding vote
And claim our right to life

Voices of dissent
Shame and disgrace
Burns the soul
For those who defy the will of man

[Daryus:]

Remember our oath of office
To keep the light shining
That you live, know
It's true
And pledge our lives
To make this vision a reality
