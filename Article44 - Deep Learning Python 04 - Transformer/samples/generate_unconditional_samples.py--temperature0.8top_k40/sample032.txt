"By The Pain I See In Others"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]

We will build a new home for you
And you will be alone there with nowhere to hide

[Daryus:]

You think you can break away from home?
And leave your family behind?

[Arhys:]

Yes, I think we can!

[Daryus:]

How dare you step inside my home!

[Arhys:]

How dare you step inside my home!?

[Fan:]

Why can't we not be friends?
It's not like home is his forte
He's too far away!?

[Fan:]

How dare you step inside my home!?

[Arhys:]

Yes, I think we can!

[Daryus:]

How dare you step inside my home!?

[Arhys:]

How dare you step inside my home!?

"Blurring Lines"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Daryus:]

Betray my blood
To save my son
A hopeless choice to make

But who am I
If not the one who's meant to keep him safe?

[Fan:]

You dare to walk a thin stand
It would put my son's future at risk
You've threatened to kill me if I don't drop the ball
Vengeance is my only and only

"Moment Of Betrayal"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Daryus:]

Don't be afraid of stepping down.
The outcry from within
On seeing his family left your side
Is burning bright

[Fan:]

They have waited for hours
To see their savior depart

[Daryus:]

No mercy for dissenters
And dissenters set their sights on tonight
It is time for you to make your stand

[Arhys:]

No mercy, no mercy
You're fighting for the honor of your mistake
And wrong is beginning to take its toll

[Arhys:]

This is your time
This is your time
You're fighting for the honor of your mistake
And wrong is beginning to take its toll

I will always remember
As the Night went down
With those words that once rang through my chest

My vigil will always remember
As I am taken to my plight
I am worth nothing as I am sold

Black procession through the narrow aisles
With the white procession drawing closer
Soon they will see our beauty fading
And losing hope
As all those lost in this year's flood
Will shudder to think of you as any other

Passing through today
It is the year of betrayal
Betrayal of my life

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]

Look behind you has shown
The way I feel
Remember me as well
As all those lost in this year's flood
Will shudder to think of you as any other

Passing through today
It is the year of betrayal
Betrayal of my life

"And The Swallows Dance Above The Sun"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[And the]

Every morrow, every year
Chokesaw at the slightest sound
The mist that covers her scar
Beneath her skin, so cold and empty
Still so innocent, so innocent

A kiss that will burn her
Heart, for evermore
A kiss that will burn her heart

And the words that once rang through my chest
Will never rest
Nor forget her voice
They will always mourn her death

And the memories that will burn within their hearts
Will never rest
Nor forget her voice
They will always mourn her death

And the words that once rang through my chest
Will never rest
Nor forget her voice
They will always mourn her death

And the sweat that covers her body
Is making me dizzy
Her memory, from infancy
Will always remain

And the tragedies that are haunting her memory
Will never rest
Nor forget her voice
They will always mourn her death

And the words that once rang through my chest
Will never rest
Nor forget her voice
They will always mourn her death

And the words that once rang through my chest
Will never rest
Nor forget her voice
