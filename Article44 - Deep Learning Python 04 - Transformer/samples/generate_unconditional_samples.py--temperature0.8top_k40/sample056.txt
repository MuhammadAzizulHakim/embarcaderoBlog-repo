======================================== SAMPLE 56 ========================================
To feel the weight in your soul

Until I hear the sound of music
I'm surfing the net
A guitar and a controller
Puzzled by the youthful air of teenage angst

I grew out my hair (breathes)
RedUX today

RedUX today

"Lightbulb Sun"

The sun is a light bulb
A candle in my hand
The colours I have chosen
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies

I don't recall when
But I'm upon a chance to be,
And I still wait
For someone who never changes

Light bulb sun set
Just the chill that you're feeling
Like you're in a rain now
Don't feel too good

You were born in '67
The year of our ultimate meeting
And you're feeling the heat of the world today

"The Gift Of Music"

It's a gift that keeps on giving
A box of tapes lying around
Mysterious and out of my head
Music keeps me sane
Strange and wonderful things
You'd never hear in a western

I sing the ballads
Of great music
And dance to the tunes
That have already been sold

Without you, I wouldn't be where I am today
Without you, I wouldn't be so alive
Without you, I wouldn't be so alive

Without you, I wouldn't be so alive
Without you, I wouldn't be so alive

"Footprints"

I saw her footprints on the sea
I knew her eyes were watching me
So I ventured further in my mind
In the hope that I would find:

"The Ones Who Rest For A Night"

My mind has a "wait for confirmation" feeling
Like the light at the end of the tunnel
If I am reading between the dogs and the moans
Then it's clear that I am into you

There was a point in time when I knew the world was ending
When I heard the distant rasp
I knew that I was moving too slow
And those days are gone now

Without you, I wouldn't be where I am today
Without you, I wouldn't be so alive
Without you, I wouldn't be so alive

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make up runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my dreams are gone
I got people underneath my skin
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
Swim with me into your blackest eyes

A few minutes with me inside my van
Should be so erotic when you're cutting out the past
and giving me a ride in the back

"Trains"

Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hiss of the train at the railway head

Always the summers are slipping away

A 60 ton angel falls to the earth
A pile of old metal, a radiant blur
Scars in the country, the summer and her

Always the summers are slipping away
Find me a way for making it stay

When I hear the engine pass
I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides
I'm in luck

When the evening reaches here
You're tying me up
I'm dying of love
It's OK

"Lips Of Ashes"

Paralysed
Lips of Ashes
Synchronised
Blue vein crashes

Touching you inside

Idolised
Black Eyes fading
You and I
Connection failing

I drill down inside

<|endoftext|>

"The Sound Of Muzak"

Hear the sound of music
Drifting in the aisles
Elevator Prozac
Stretching on for miles

The music of the future
Will not entertain
It's only meant to repress
And neutralize your brain

Soul gets squeezed out
Edges get blunt
Demographic
Gives what you want

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world
