Cause misery
And salvation
As the night went on

"Hours Of Wealth"

Found out about the gold
Futile eye for an eye
Long held belief that sight is the answer
Learn to fear the sound of music

Watching my brother play
The instruments take me higher

I'm getting older
And I realize that I'm not as big of a girl
I was once led home
But my home is no longer here

Watching my brother play
The instruments take me higher

I'm getting even
And I realize that I'm not as big of a girl
I was once led home
But my home is no longer here

Watching my brother play
The instruments take me higher
Watching my brother play
The answer lies within

"The Blind House"

If you wanna stay
Always here
All these years
The last frontier
It's no concern of theirs
The world outside
Corrupting me
So trust these eyes

Faith is in your soul
But in these walls
Hormones stall
Dogs will crawl
The vices and the doubt
We resist
All this shit
So kneel submit

Free love
Free love
Feel love in all my sisters
Breathe out
Breathe out
Breathe out
Breathe out
Breathe out
Breathe out

"Great Expectations"

A summer day
In garlands I feel secure
A useless faith
That I will get you, somehow

Reach out and fuck all your clothes
A boy sings a lullaby
You helplessly turn to your mother

ain't got time to herself
ain't feel so out of reach
a child's rhyme
Will you take the time to explain

What a charlatan
You keep promises to this degree
But can't deliver yourself

I'm begging for your blood
I'm begging for your faith
I'm begging for your time
I'm begging for your life

"Hush"

Fuck youuuuuuu!

I can't see your face
I can't breathe your air
And I can't tell you when to run

I can't tell you how much I hate you
I can't tell you how much I love you
I can't tell you when to burn

But I'm not gonna lie
And I know that sometimes
I just gotta put up with you
I'm not gonna lie

I hate myself
I'm not gonna lie
I hate you
I'm not gonna lie

I hate myself
I'm not gonna lie
I hate you
I'm not gonna lie

I hate yourself
I'm not gonna lie
I hate you

I hate yourself
I'm not gonna lie
I hate you
I hate you
I hate you
I hate you
I hate you

"Until The Sound Of A Hymn"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatrees
Are you listening too far in?
You know the kind of song it is
You know the kind of sound that we're gonna make
But you didn't know the first thing about a new song
You know the kind of sound that we're gonna make
But you didn't know the sound was so new?

Don't let the day that you wake up on it's gone
Go fetch your guitar
Don't let it pass you by
Don't let the day that you lay awake in
Pass the time running
Through the writing
To make the next educated decision

"Shesmovedon"

You move in waves
Like Autumn leaves
Ooooh and snow
Bathing my feet with their water

Summer is miles and miles away
And no-one would ask me to stay

Dead along with you
And the children you bring
And the empty streets you walk
Spread with sails of truth

Summer is miles and miles away
And no
