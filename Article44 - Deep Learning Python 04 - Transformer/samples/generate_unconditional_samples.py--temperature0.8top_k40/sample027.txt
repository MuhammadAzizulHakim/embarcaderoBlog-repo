======================================== SAMPLE 27 ========================================
The creator of MTV, the world's most watched series, has died
His voice was heard through the glass as MTV took his life.
MTV was born
In a falling storm
MTV lost its glow
MTV made of glass
The world's most watched series
found MTV's savior

"MTV Is For Columbine"

Silent crowd pleasers
Protesters burn, murder threat
Protesters throw stones
Protesters clash
Students gather
For the rare occasion
To watch a free summer

A tale of two lives
One man's chance for a new adventure

Corruption, lust and greed
Defines the criteria
For many a kid's decision

The decision that should have been made
Was made at all
The anguish that life has left me

Silent crowd pleasers
Protesters burn, murder threat
Protesters throw stones
Protesters clash
U.S. president

Without pen and paper
They can't read my mind

Neither can they
They will never know my love
My brother and I

We traveled to Great Expectations
They will be forever grateful

We made the right choice
With love and light
Through music
They learned to love me

"The Seance"

Under gas light the silence cracks
A bullet hits the concrete
The candle lights up
The mist spreads about
The dancing black
As the musicians die

Black then white are all I see
Red and yellow are all I hear
Red and yellow are all I see

The seance

I'm on the roof
There's a God inside
I can't see without you
I'm on the roof

There's a God inside
I can't see without you
I'm on the roof

God, creator, killer
Just wait on the other side

"The Trouble With Evan"

[I. Oversaturation]

Any grade schooler knows that there is a retard in the water
And every other summer day Evan will need a ride home
From somewhere higher up the inoat

Any grade schooler knows that there is a math savant in the water
And every other summer day Evan will need to buy a new car
From somewhere higher up the inoat

Any grade schooler knows that there is a man who knows the moon and knows the sun
And when we meet again 'til the moon turns into the sky
It's over now
But it's so worth it

[II. The Betrayal]

In school we began to find the clues
The world begins to breathe
By the way, I'm gonna miss my family forever

If I come down here with you today
It'll give me the clues
The world begins to breathe
By the way, I'm gonna miss my family forever

Betrayal at the hands of prejudice
A bloodless parting of the way
I'm forgiven until I repent

And even if I did end up like you
My gravity would slip away
You could leave me wandering the streets
Or just wandering around

Nothing ever changes
So forsake the good times
And look to the future
Nothing ever changes

And after all the chaos and love am I left behind
I'm left behind
You're left alone
With all the compassion and the hope
That looks like a candle's price
I'm left alone
With all the compassion and the hope
That
I can't see your face anymore
So I'll pretend it's not there
It's just a memory
And a feeling
I never knew
So Full of Hope

And now I know why I long for it so often
When the night comes
And when life gets in the way
I won't know if I'll remain

And if life gets in the way
I'll never be open again
Wondering when this day will come

And if life gets in the way
I'll never be open again
Wondering when this day will come

"Scarred"

To Rise again
To be a new charlatan
To worship the one who killed your friend

You belong in darkness
Just wait until you belong in god above all

Empty vessel for the weak
Breathe into the void
Wake up to your sound

But you're still young
And you refused to believe
Breathe into the void
Take over the charlatan

Empty vessel for the weak
Breathe into the void

Blame it all on the gods
They've uncovered the killer
They hope you will join them
In the pouring of blood
Red
