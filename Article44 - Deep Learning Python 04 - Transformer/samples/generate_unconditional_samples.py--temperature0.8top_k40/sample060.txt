======================================== SAMPLE 60 ========================================
Into a suburb of his mind

If I still had something left
I believe I'd break down and burn
And burn it toen this diary
Right in the air

I'm sitting on the ceiling
I don't know how I'll write this down
But I'm getting nowhere
And nowhere is still hell

I'm sitting in the concrete
I'm getting worse
And worse
With no end in sight
I can't seem to shake this feeling
Something's missing
I've lost all hope
I'm sitting in the concrete
I'm getting worse
And worse
With no end in sight
I can't seem to get away
Something's missing
I've lost all hope
I'm sitting in the concrete
I'm getting worse
And worse
With no end in sight
I can't seem to get away
Something's missing
I've lost all hope
I'm sitting in the concrete
I'm getting worse
And worse

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

Sacrifice my life
Neglect my kids and wife
All for you to be happy
All those sleepless nights
And countless fights to give you more
And then you say how dare that
I didn't write you back
I must be too good for you
I only care about myself

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

"Sacrificed Sons"

[Begins with samples from 9/11]

Walls are closing
Anxiously
Channel surfing
Frantically

Burning City
Smoke and fire
Planes we're certain
Faith inspired

No clues
A complete surprise
Who'll be
Coming home tonight

Heads all turning
Towards the sky
Towers crumble
Heroes die

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

Teach them what to think and feel
Your ways so enlightening
Words they preach I can't relate
If God's true Love are acts of Hate?

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

God on High
Our mistakes
Will mankind be extinct?

There's no time,
Time to waste
Who serves the truth
For Heavens' sake?

"Octavarium"

[I. Someone Like Him] [0:00 ‒ 8:47]

I never want to again.

It's so hard for me to know.

It's such a burden to feel welcome.
And it's so hard for me to feel respected.

And it's such a pain for me to feel like I'm on their side.

And it's such a pain to know that I still fight
For them to see me on their side.

So, for the first time in a long time.
I don't wanna be alone.
I don't wanna be alone

There's so much I want to say.
And it's all the same to you...
So, would you like to see me?
Take my hand,
Hold my... open wide.
Shoulder to shoulder with you
And take my hand,
Take my hand,
Open wide.

[II. Loving Him] [8:48 ‒ 13:49]

He is the reason I cling to dreams
He is the reason I keep turning away
He is the reason I seek sympathy
He is the reason I seek trust
He is the reason I seek life

I can't face another day.

As you seek to destroy me
I show you don't always know what you're doing
I can't face another day.

And as you seek to forgive me
I show you don't always know what you're doing
I can't face another day.
