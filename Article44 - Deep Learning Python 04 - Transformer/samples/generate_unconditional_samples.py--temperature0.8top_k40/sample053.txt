"Answering the Dark"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Daryus:]

Betray my blood
To save my son
A hopeless choice to make

But who am I
If not the one who's meant to keep him safe?

Is trust and loyalty still justified
If I deny him of a better life?

Gabriel
Has always respected my life
Until now we've been intertwined
Even as the day draws near

No longer can we only call upon him
To do his best to you

Is it time for us to drop the game?

Is it time to make a change?

Evangeline
I swore to you
To love and guide our son

Destiny's a new day

Brother, I swear to you

Peace be my name
I will never leave you

Gabriel
Weeps for his life
Eyes upon his son

"Act Of Faythe"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Faythe:]

I never knew
Someone was out there
A long way from nowhere
Who could open my eyes

Could be the one
Who saved my life that fateful morning

Her story is one that I'll never forget
She was fearless and brave
Fighting for her life
And it's one that I'll never forget

I will miss her
It will be a regret to say goodbye
To those who understand
I will treasure every minute of every day
And I will never forget

She was just a child
With all the fighting left in her
She would play and cry
She would seek balance in my hands

Her light would carry her
She would pull the trigger
She would shoot to kill
It was right in the family
She was just a child
With all the fighting left in her
She would play and cry
She would seek balance in my hands

Her light would carry her
She would pull the trigger
She would shoot to kill
It was right in the family
She was just a child
With all the fighting left in her
She would play and cry
She would seek balance in my hands

Her light would carry her
She would pull the trigger
She would shoot to kill
It was right in the family
She was just a child
With all the fighting left in her
She would play and cry
She would seek balance in my hands

"Moment Of Betrayal"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Moment of betrayal]

She is acting very strange
Fever deep within her heart
Things could not be worse
Desperate to escape from her loneliness
This feeling is building inside of her
Every day she keeps looking for a way back home

Breaking waves breaking the night
Rising above the cold ocean
She is searching for a way
To slip away
She is searching for a way to stay alive

Rising above the water
She is searching for hope
She is searching for a change
She is searching for a change she can't find
I searching for a way to live

Rising above the water
She is searching for hope
She is searching for a change she can't find
I searching for a way to die

"Hope Leaves"

After all the chaos and death
Everything is new and wonderful
I feel even stranger when the pain is real
I feel even stranger when the pain is real

We didn't know each other before
We had so much in common
We didn't know how to live this way
We just had to learn to throw away the key

After all the chaos and death
Everything is new and wonderful
I feel even stranger when the pain is real
I feel even stranger when the pain is real

We didn't know each other before
We just had to learn to throw away the key

We just had to learn to throw away the key

Now that we know each other
We just need to take it
Take it like a brother and like us
We don't deserve to live this way

It's time for us to take it
Take it like a brother and like us
We don't deserve to live this way

Change is coming, and it's only a matter of time
Before the baying of the dead
