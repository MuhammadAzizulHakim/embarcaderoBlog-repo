======================================== SAMPLE 86 ========================================
I'm left behind
Like all the others
Some fall for you
It doesn't make much difference if they do

She talks about her love
And as I'm getting older
She talks about her life
And as I get older
She talks about her life
And she talks about me

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

Sacrifice my life
Neglect my kids and wife
All for you to be happy
All those sleepless nights
And countless fights to give you more
And then you say how dare that
I didn't write you back
I must be too good for you
I only care about myself

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

"Sacrificed Sons"

[Begins with samples from 9/11]

Walls are closing
Anxiously
Channel surfing
Frantically

Burning City
Smoke and fire
Planes we're certain
Faith inspired

No clues
A complete surprise
Who'll be
Coming home tonight

Heads all turning
Towards the sky
Towers crumble
Heroes die

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

Teach them what to think and feel
Your ways so enlightening
Words they preach I can't relate
If God's true Love are acts of Hate?

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

God on High
Our mistakes
Will mankind be extinct?

There's no time,
Time to waste
Who serves the truth
For Heavens' sake?

"Octavarium"

[I. Someone Like Him] [0:00 â€’ 8:47]

He's just someone I'd like to meet
Nothing more than a name fan
He doesn't seem to understand that I care
He even wonders if I care who he is

I don't like this person much
I don't like the way he looks at me
I don't like the way he talks to me
But I will fight like hell to be the man who I am

I don't like this person much
I don't like the way he looks at me
But I will fight like hell to be the man who I am

It's not my turn,
It's yours
I'm not afraid
To tread lightly
On the path that divides
Never forsake this fight

Nothing is what I feel
My trust in you
To build my world on trust
Leading to my soul

Something has to give
This person's name
Something has to go

Anticipate the moment
Nothing's what I feel
Your presence will keep me sane
Avoid the chaos that's tearing us apart
Take things slow and controlled
Out of your way

I may never get over
But I'll rise to the top

I'll never be all alone
I'll never trust you
Trust me you won't take anything
And take what you want

Nothing is what I feel
My body will take (now)
It's too late for me now
To try and forget you

I'll never be all alone
I'll never be alone

Nothing is what I feel
My body will take (now)
It's too late for me now
To try and forget you

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden within
Open wounds hidden under my skin

Pain is real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Staring at me crying

[CHORUS]
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can
