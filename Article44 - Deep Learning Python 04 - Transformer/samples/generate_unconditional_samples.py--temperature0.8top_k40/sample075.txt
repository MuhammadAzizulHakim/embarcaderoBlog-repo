======================================== SAMPLE 75 ========================================
I'm sorry I couldn't see you
Show me your face
And I'll never leave - until I hear your story
Through your eyes
Your mouth is cold and empty
And you draw the line in your head
Sometimes I feel I'm the colour of air
Sometimes I'm the colour of shadows
And you draw the line somehow
There's no turning back

I'm sorry I couldn't see you
Show me your face
And I'll never leave - until I hear your story
Through your eyes
Your mouth is cold and empty
And you draw the line in your head
Sometimes I feel I'm the colour of air
Sometimes I'm the colour of shadows

"Standing In The Sun"

You're dancing in the noose
You're pointing your finger
You're getting up, going down
You're marching up, getting nowhere
You're Tupac Shakur

You're sitting in the window
You ignore the ticking clocks
You ignore the traffic light
You ignore the car engine
You ignore the traffic light
You ignore the clocks
And you're still alone
In this concrete courtyard
You're finding peace of mind

"I Walk Beside You"

You're us and underground
You're laughing and rage
You'retering through your oldies
You're listening to the beat
Nothing but the truth will feed your doubt
And you're losing your pride

In this concrete courtyard
We're basking the same water as the first morning
We're basking the same water as the last

"Light My Way"

If I take you by the hand and lead you through each day
Then we'll know what's left and what's ahead
I promise to make you proud
And I promise to make you cry

On and on and on it goes
It's so easy to run away with nothing in

When I find I've taken you by the hand and
Lead you through each day
I know what's ahead and what's left
I promise to make you proud
And I promise to make you cry

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make up runs

I'm in the store to buy a gun
And a man is waiting to steal my heart
I'm in the store to buy a gun
And a man is waiting to steal my heart

"Trains"

Train set and match at the track
Flush away my sins
And all my harridan's won

Train set and match at the track
Flush away my sins
And all my harridan's won

Train set and match at the track
Flush away my sins
And all my harridan's won

Train set and match at the track
Flush away my sins
And all my harridan's won

"The Rest Will Flow"

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced?

Into a suburb of heaven
Yeah, it's a suburb of hell

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced?

There's something in the water
That makes me wanna swim
But I'm not good enough
Forget all your other things
You're gonna fix me
When I'm done with this life
You'll leave me begging for more

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced?

You know you wanna be a hero
So get your mask off and don't be afraid
I'm not gonna hide behind your facade
I'm afraid of what you will say
Your behavior is unforgivable
But I'm here to stay

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced?

I can relate
If I call your home
It will be repaired
Soon enough
I'll be a star to remember
It was always gonna be
I'm sorry if I'm not around
I wish I weren't so
So sorry for not being there
