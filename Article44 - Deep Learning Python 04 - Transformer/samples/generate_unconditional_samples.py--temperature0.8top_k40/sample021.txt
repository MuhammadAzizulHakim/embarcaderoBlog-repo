Why so surprised?

I didn't know
Someone was out there
A long way from nowhere
Who could open my eyes

Someone was lost
Nameless Predators
Flying back to my home
Far out of reach
Why so surprised?

I didn't know
Someone was missing
No sign of humanity
I just couldn't wait

When will there be a day when all of us
Believe me
When will the long lost night
Never fade away

"Untethered Angel"

You've built this world around you
Your universe
In spite of best intentions
Things could not be worse
Chaos and fear are signs of faith
Love is a sign of faith
For us to face this path together
We still need to unite
We still need to rise above

We don't always know
Misunderstood

Faces that defy reason
Promise is freedom
Hope is a burden too

We're learning all about our own mortality
The uninvited stranger
Oblivious to what he has learned

Unwelcome stranger
Always wary of his assistance
Adapted from "The Trouble With Evan"

Unwelcome stranger
Always wary of his assistance

Unwelcome stranger
Always wary of his assistance

"Paralyzed"

The anger and the pressure
Inside me burned
To feel like I'd never leave my home again

Why do I feel so low?
I'm not the kind that leaves her alone

She's holding back
She's trying to find
Something new
Swearing allegiance
To anyone but herself

Why do I feel so low?
I'm not the kind that leaves her alone

She's not the kind of girl that dreams of her seductive looks
But she'd never want anyone but herself

Why do I feel so low?
I don't wanna be alone and I don't want to feel like I never will

She's 16
 She's in her twenties
Can teenage angst overblown?
When will this all stop?

Why do I feel so low?
I'm not the kind that leaves her alone

She's holding back
She's trying to find
Something new
Swearing allegiance
To anyone but herself

"Scarred"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]
As fearless leader of the Raven's Den
The blood of warriors
Flows throughout my veins

Honesty and honesty
Make no mistake
 The Enemy Within

Content to feed off the chaos
The Enemy Within

This is not what we've always done
Crossing over into the shadows
Open wide, lest you be consumed

You're fighting for the honor and the pride
That says, "I'm your ally
I can help you break through the walls."

Taking lives is never a solution
It's only a waste of time
Don't take my word for an answer

Gabriel
You're a hero within my heart
And I'm looking for a way to welcome him home
He's a man who I can't ignore

Not questioning your courage
Justign my respect
And lead the way
That lies ahead

We'll learn together
As we latch on to the wheel
As our shared humanity
Will the baying of the hounds forest
Tell us what they want and why
And when to cite, remember to cough

Give us the credit we need
Clean it up, wipe it all dust
A feather in the dust

Brother can you please stop saying
That I don't sleep a wink?
And step right into the
Deadly Mire

Don't you dare tell me
That you don't wanna die?
Brother can you please stop saying
That you don't wanna die?

It's time for you to deal
Becoming all too real
living in fear-
Why did you lie and pretend?
This has come to an end
You're innocent as all refugees
There's no turning back

I can't live like this
I know you'll never want me
And I know you'll never be proud of me

I could never let you down
I know you're shattered
you got away with murder
But I didn't give you life
I didn't give you life

You build me up
I erase you
So I can't let you down

Decisions like these
Your do or die
Not an easy thing to undertake
But one that I have come to believe

I can live with this
I can't let you down

You're a monster now
Justify the
