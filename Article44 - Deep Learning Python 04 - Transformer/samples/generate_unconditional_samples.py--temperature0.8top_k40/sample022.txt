One last time
Something monumental had happened.
The universe grew cold and black
Searching for a new home.
A new home where the light of the universe
first touched
Touching the heart of our most precious piece of jewelry.

The long, black hair was waving goodbye
To moments of sadness.
She held her breath for a moment
to contemplate her beautiful child.

Without hesitation, she raised her head to me.
Without hesitation, she raised her head to me.

And as if on purpose lit his candle
With a halo of sulphur
That burning question that could not be answered.

"Why do you moan and moan and moan?"
"That doesn't make them any less human"
"Humankind has reached a turning point. It is time for a change."
"We're going to alter everything."

Now the key is in the ignition.
The car is waiting.
The girl is yours
Congratulations are due to the men and that will go towards controlling your life

Once upon a time there was a void beyond which life could not perse
Until we spoke.
Plunging into the deepest void of our all earthlylessness.
Until we spoke and we began to make sense of our past
The eternal silence that greeted us here

One of the many instruments of our destruction
 was responding.
It was orchestrating the destruction of our world
until we spoke.
Promising salvation for our quest
and yet another challenge awaiting us all

The fated catalyst
Was already there by the stifling wind.
She could have stopped the tide before it had even crossed the waterline.
Yet she chose not to let go.

Whispered, snorkeling, weaving her way through the hair and the grey matter
That had been her covering letter to me.
Unaware as she was of my presence, she rose to her feet
and placed her hand on my shoulder.
Her words were the catalyst for my thought to move,
and now it has been our fate.

It is the catalyst for thought to move,
and now it is our fate.

It is the catalyst for thought to move,
and now it is our fate.

"Visions Of My Family"

[I. Loving, Hearing, and Conversation (Live)]

I spent so long asking myself,
Could this be the beginning of the end?
After all the suffering and the silence
I don't wanna be alone and know what will be
And my heart is bleeding bad

After all the noise and the chatter and the screaming
I got lost in the chaos of the world
And the pills that kept on giving
Nothing seemed to help
And I turned to my family for help

I thought that it was the end of an era
But in the vision that we once had
We found courage in the face of our greatest fear

It is the catalyst for thought to move
And now it is our fate.

It is the catalyst for thought to move
And now it is our fate.

It is the catalyst for thought to move
And now it is our fate.

"The Enemy Inside"

Over a glass moonlight
We passed awater bridges
Majestic ballerinas
Ancient battlements
And forgotten battles
We passed alake bridges
Alley out in the stream

One of the wonders of the world
Was stolen from me
A better world
Beneath my embrace

I passed awater bridges
Alley out in the stream

Was stolen from me
A better world

"Water"

"Like a wound that bleeds again"
I lose myself to the ether
Like a stone that falls away
And reappears in a new age

Empty people I see
Children's laughter from the rubble
Electricity from the rain
Water so warm that she sleeps
My blood so clean that she forgot to cover her head
Sunkist tourists wait to see me

Adoring crowds, dancing in the rain
Many of them foreign nationals
We had ourselves to blame
For sinking deeper and deeper

Under the surface waters of our oceans
The sounds of clocks, the lines that trace our history
And the memories that run through my head

Like a wound that bleeds again
I lose myself to the ether
Like a stone that falls away
And reappears in a new age

Fill the empty spectator with doubt
Nothing seems real
The spectator is moved aside
As the empty spectator is emptied of the one he cares

Like a
