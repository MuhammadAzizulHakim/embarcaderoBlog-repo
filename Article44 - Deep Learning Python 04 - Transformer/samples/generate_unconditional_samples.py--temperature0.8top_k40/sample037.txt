======================================== SAMPLE 37 ========================================
I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have undone than have undone myself
than have undone myself,
particularly when it's economic
In the short run
It's better to be forgiven than am I
When it comes to our physical state
There's a darkness in us all
And we sometimes concede
That we can't seem to reach that far
When we stumble in this way
We're forgiven is we feel
Another day we'll reap the harvest

"Harvest"

Pull me undone
The pen must be bleeding pain
The lyrics fragile
The river must be burning
Woman must be alive
Someday she will be seeing me

Where can I find my son?
When will he be old enough to remember
And where will I find my son?
When can I take him?
When is his new country home?
When can I take him?
When is his new home?

"America the Beautiful"

Hope came to a tragic end
Shept at her son's grave

Tragedy sets a new standard for mankind
Treat all men like family
Under a sun that never sets ablaze

Resting in her golden glow
I'm awaiting the dawn
She knows when to turn and return
To rest in her light

"Pull Me Under"

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced?

Into a suburb of heaven
Yeah, it should've been forever
It all seems to paint a shadow on this place
Even getting to know the people
Who hold the secret underground
has left me with the cold clear eye

Somewhere like a scene from a memory
I'm falling through
I'm falling right under
This girl will be forever grateful

Heart sick with sorrow
(She lives in '67)
But she will never leave me
She gave away all her secrets
So trust her with one last heart

Someday she will bewaiting for your arrival
She'll wonder why
Where can I find my son?
When will he be old enough to remember
And when will she be standing by

She is waiting alone
She is a burden for her to see
She has no one by her side
She confides in him her plans
And when she thinks she has it all wrapped up
He will be her last

Heart sick with sorrow
(She lives in '67)
But she will never leave me
She gave away all her secrets
So trust her with one last heart

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make up runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my dreams are dead
I got people underneath my skin
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
And I will tie you a knot just to watch the sunshine die

I got schoolgirls confessing to me
I got ducks in ponds all dripping with lead
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
And I will tie you a knot just to watch the sunshine die
