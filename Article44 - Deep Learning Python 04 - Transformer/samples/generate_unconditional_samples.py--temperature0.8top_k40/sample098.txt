And still I dream of the feeling
I must see the prize still there
And surely I will find it

And I had a good dream last night
Of getting a place where I could stay
Heed the sound of my sighs
And still I'll be free this time

"Lightbulb Sun"

The white light of the sun is a light bulb
A candle's a treat
The air is thick and easy to get lost
But I came to visit with my son
And my clothes were all vacant
I wonder if the cold wind was a concern for me

In the shackles of the night
I could wander and drape my clothes
But the beauty of my vision
appears in the clouds
in the form of a butterfly

In the shackles of the night
I could linger in place,
and give away the key
but the day is late today
I am carried by the current
On a black and blue moon
(Tomorrow's blasphemy)

"Transcending Time"

Drifting in a spiral of time
I am in contact with the future
The unbroken spirit
Who can enlighten and enlighten
If we divide our efforts among
The enhancers and the pessimists

We are through the breaking wave
Out of the blackness
Of the beginning

In the presence of hate
There is no love without respect
There is no faith without pain
There is no salvation without sin

Through the eternal flame
Of our salvation
Through the light of our light

Divided I am on the cutting edge
Continuing my quest

To reach higher planes
As I reach the end of this road
I will be a full moon at night
A hot dog and a Coke
I will soar to new heights

Divided I am on the cutting edge
Continuing my quest

To reach higher planes
As I reach the end of this road
I will be a full moon at night
A hot dog and a Coke
I will soar to new heights

"Halo"

Weary soldier of the state
Underneath the disguise of a hopeful citizen
The killer is just a killer

The sound of heavy rain is like a war deadening wind
Downing pallets of wine
As night descends in silence
The killer is just a killer

The victim of a violent crime
Unwelcome guest at last sanctuary
The apathetic narrator is just another man

Voices grow with the night
As night descends in silence
The killer is just a killer

"Lightbulb Sun"

The bulb sun is a light bulb
A light bulb is anything but.
It's really just a bulb
A light bulb is anything but.

But it's free love that keeps me sane
I can't live my life too often
I'm getting nervous about my breathing
And I'm sweating, thinking, and feeling
Not great at all

What if the rest of the world went to save me?
They'd all be laughing at me
What if the rest of the world went and forgot me?
I'd be so lonely and cold

olated and numb
I can't shake the longing for her forever
I can't break out of this isolation
She's trying to find me a way
To get away from this pain
I'm so trying to hold on
And forget all about the rest of my life

A light bulb sun is something to look at
And know that she loved me
And that I could not ignore her

I'm trying to find my way back home
And I'm sweating, thinking, and feeling
Not great at all

What if the rest of the world went to save me?
They'd all be laughing at me
What if the rest of the world went and forgetting me?
I'd be so lonely and cold

Oh, what if the rest of the world went and forgot me?
What if the rest of the world went and forgot me?

"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here"

Never stop the car on a drive in the dark
Never look for the truth in your mother's eyes
Never trust the sound of rain upon a river
Rushing through your ears

Arriving somewhere but not here

Did you imagine the final sound as a gun?
Or the smashing windscreen of a car?
Did you ever imagine the final sound as a gun?

Did you see the red mist block your path?
Did the scissors cut a way to your heart?
Did you know the mirror on your wall would
