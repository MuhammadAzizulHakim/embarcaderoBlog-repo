======================================== SAMPLE 19 ========================================
When there's trouble admitting that you have been wrong all along
When the words you have written down reads "everything is gone"

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

When you slake the thirst of desire
You are loved and respected
And your delusions taken away
When you fall prey to the endless

"In The Mist She Was Standing"

Since the sun has gone down
The moon rides high
The day when the world has lost its pain

She was standing right in between
Bleeding from the sun
And wisdom and strength
Spurring her sorrow into the night

She wasn't afraid of pain
She was strong enough to face it
Standing strong enough

She would not let her age
Take away her hope
She was ready to resist
She would not let her loneliness
Leaving her to it

She was standing right in between
Bleeding from the sun
And wisdom and strength
Spurring her sorrow into the night

She wasn't afraid of pain
She was strong enough to face it
Standing strong enough to face it
Standing strong enough

She was standing right in between
Bleeding from the sun
And wisdom and strength
Spurring her sorrow into the night

"The Leper Affinity"

We entered Winter once again
Dusk was a beautiful day
Now it's cold and black
Ruby eyes gave birth to a flame

We walked across the fields
Swathed in sorrow, blackened memory
We were led into a lifetime
There we stitched my name
And bedecked with fear

We walked across the fields
Swathed in sorrow, blackened memory
We were led into a lifetime
There we stitched my name
And bedecked with fear

"Hex Omega"

Two years
In a cell
They told me
You can't let a sorrow build
On you own imagination

Two hearts
Addicted to the game
They took me for a ride
Two eyes
Gold against the cold

You can't let a sorrow build

"Just Let Me Breathe"

Open your eyes and let me breathe

Shake your grip and let me breathe
Let me breathe in

One seal
One man
One voice
One colour
One moment
One step
One way out

Sailing on the sevens
The sevens bring us wonderful joy
When she cries
We're left with nothing but the sky

She can never know you're there
For love's infamy

Clouds of dust in the sign of dawn
The sun beats down on the coldest night
And she waits for you in the nest
She gave birth to a man this world doesn't know

"Serenity Painted Death"

You're getting old
And gravity's on your side
You're swimming in the calm
And you're surfing the noose

Sailing on the sevens
The sevens bring us wonderful joy
When she cries
We're left with nothing but the sky

She can never know you're there
For love's infamy

Sailing on the sevens
The sevens bring us wonderful joy
When she cries
We're left with nothing but the sky

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make up runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my urges
