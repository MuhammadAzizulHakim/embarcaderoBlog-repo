======================================== SAMPLE 96 ========================================
We know better
It's better to stumble and be wrong
We'll get what we need most

Learning from misery
denial and doubt
feeding our children
helplessness and doubt
enslavement

[H:]
"The Matrix"

I never knew
Children always begging me
For more
Transform me now
Make me a hero
Transform me now

I can't live under a bad life
No I can't too much
When I'm too blind
I hear the cries
I'm inspired
They light up the sky
Like new ambitions come true

[V:]
"Bring me back again"

I'm inspired
They light a fire under the water
Mine are flames of pure desire

"Beneath The Surface"

Beyond the surface lies a vast emptiness
Empty of all reason and reason alone

The void that once held us is closing us out
We're like the rain in your eye
Tearing you down and emptying you into the bottle

As you swim in the deep end
Keep your head on a fork in the road
Neither the current nor the water
Stay below the water's edge

Spirits fly through the heavy fog
All the while looking for the current
Currents that made us jump out of the sky
Drifting in circles around us
And never ending at a winter's flood

The wind moves in strange things like a car engine
The waves in dreams of things never seen
And when the night comes down you can never forget

"At Wit's End"

Forever more
Our heart is in your hands
We're reaching for the unknown
Watch it all burn into our eyes

White wine in the mist of night
Black magic, turning dreams into realities
Changing the course of a thousand tries
Changing the course of a thousand tries

It burns in the dark
Everytime I turn around
It burns in the dark

"Transcending Time"

Death is coming...
It's passing us by
Through the haze of dreams

Lepers coiled neath the clouds
Dying men in the light

Mercy in the dark
Heart in the dark

Time and time again
It's the crossroads...
The brink of damnation
Before the snake has a thought
Before the snake has a word
Before the snake has a word

Mercy in the dark
Heart in the dark

"Beneath The Surface"

"Deep within the fabric of reality is a false sense of urgency
A pit of fear is underground
Fear is spreading like a flu, and trancelike quality is evident
Health is slipping like a flu, and I don't know when I will finally
Clear the residue
The enigma surrounding me

Controlling this anxiety is me

I'm not sure I know how to live with my own wellbeing
I'm not sure I have the strength to take the blame
When someone I love
I see a wound that heals in the light of research
We moved to the city to begin with
We never planned to move to the city
We're not sure where to start

When I see the message
When I see the obstacles
That I cannot see, I'm afraid to step out of my comfort zone
I'm not sure I know how to live with my own wellbeing
I'm not sure I have the answers
These anxiety ridden tantrums that I've been having
Keep your head covered, your hands in your pockets
Keep your head covered, your head in the sun

A head full of doubt
A hole that no-one can reach
A desperation driving me

Head full of doubt
A pack of misfits
They're reaching for the moon
They may have found a cure for my son, but they're not prescribing it
Head full of doubt
A pack of misfits
They Terran with me now
Head full of doubt

"Breaking All Illusions"

With the sun in place
There's a fever pushing through
Someone is dying
In the corner of my eye

As if on purpose
I try to silence the sounds
That are passing through

Breaking all illusions
Making my own mind at will
Breaking all beliefs
Making my own mind at will

[indistinct]

With the help of words
Like patience, faith and reason
I have broken all illusions
Making my own mind at will

<|endoftext|>

"Controlling" Me

What I want and what I need
Don't judge
Don't judge me
Not
