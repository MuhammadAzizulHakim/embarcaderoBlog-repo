======================================== SAMPLE 74 ========================================
I'm moving, I'm moving
Out of my own world
And into another

I'm moving, I'm moving
Up, down, and away
From another life
And into another

I'm moving, I'm moving
Up, down, and away
From another life
And into another

"Disappear"

We made the world believe we didn't care
We gate crashed parties and just stood and stared
We moved in slow motion
We weren't there to stay

We made the world believe we didn't care
We gate crashed parties and just stood and stared
We moved in slowly but surely
We weren't there to stay

And shadows continue to obscure our vision
Weighing the news that we don't want to believe
We're moving, we're moving
Up, down, and away
From another life
And into another

"Flicker"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light to come
Only the people who always think they know best

"Bonnie The Cat"

Can't feel the pain that I expected
I still place keys in the ignition
I know what will be
One thought is stopping me from sleeping
I saw the future and it's breeding
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

There are three things that I would die for
But I am sure you're not one of them
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

[Whispered:]
You think you've got it all wrapped up now
You stumble on so unsuspecting
I know what will be)

I hold your birth control to ransom
The cells divide and grow inside you
I know what will be

"Black Dahlia"

You have no interest in the past
Where you came from
Where you're going to

There's a cliche in your eye
File the edges down
Soon be underground

There's nothing here for you under the sun
There's nothing new to do, it's all been done
So put your faith in another place

Never seem to get away from this
It's all falling into an abyss
So put your foot on the pedal boy

All you know is secondhand
The bullet passed through the cage behind you

You stole the only thing you love
So unfaithful, the drop is fatal

"Remember Me Lover"

I didn't want to feel like a slave to your mood swings
And I'm not saying anything I wouldn't say with my own eyes
And it's just not enough for me
I know what will be

I know what will be

I know what will be

I know what will be

And I know what will be

I know what will be

"Fear Of A Blank Planet"

Sunlight coming through the haze
No gaps in the blinds
To let it inside
The bed is unmade,
Some music still plays

TV, yeah it's always on
The flicker on the screen
A movie actress screams
I'm basking the shit flowing out of it

I'm stoned in the mall again
Terminally bored
Shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting is getting so last year's thing

X-Box is a god to me
A finger on the switch
My mother is a bitch
My father gave up ever trying to talk to me

I don't know why I'm constantly shushing
The vaguest of shrugs
One simple thing that I never do
But I never will

My mother makes me weak
My father gave up ever trying to talk to me

I'm wasting my breath on a loud light
I'm choking in the mall again
Terminally bored
Shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting is getting so last year's thing

X-Box is a god to me

My father gave up ever trying to talk to me

Terminally bored
Shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting
