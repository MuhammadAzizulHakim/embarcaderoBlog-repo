Overheard them talking,
The sun's rising again,
Should we call the shots?

Overheard them talking,
The sun's rising again,
Should we do all we can to minimize the damage?

"I thought you could control life, but it's not like that. There are things that you can't control."
"I can't control what you see or hear. I've gone to great lengths to make sure that I'm right... and I'm wrong."
"... and you can't just let it go.
You have to try and read between the lines."
"What I'm trying to say is that nothing you say can make a difference. There are things that you can cure, and there are things that you can't cure.
You can't train the vampire to love you. That's just wrong."
"I feel that you can't train a being like that... To love someone of your own species...
You must propagate the faith that makes you proud."

And though we bring vast new wealth and power, we do so through violent means.
And though we bring this wealth and power, we do so through violent means.

We are not the ones who end up on the moon
We're not the last to see it, mind you.

We are the ones who will stay behind to gaze
Upon the spectacle
Of our collective head

Blackness awakens
Soul questing
Senses weakening
Heart still weak

Out of patience
With perverted desires

Faint flickering of her light
Still she strives
To appear innocent
Things are getting so dark
Crying "Where is she?"

What is it like to watch your most precious possession fade away?
Feeling like a captive parent
I'm told there's a new love that's born
Within the wreckage
Of a broken home

Not much can go wrong
In this crucible of falling

And I don't want my blood running over you
So just let me wash my hands of this."

I'm feeling a burning desire to know
When will this be over?
When will I finally understand?

"You are not the same as me. I am just a man. I am just a man. I have my own thoughts and ideas and
Wills to live and wills to die. I am just a man. I am just a man. I have my own thoughts and ideas and wills
Just let me wash my hands of this."

How can I know you?
For what?
For who?

You are loved and respected around the world
Yet you hardly appear
There is something I can revere

In holy pages I print
Of life so soon followed
By the end of this door
I walk the streets alone
In a world that feels no time has come

I feel the burn
