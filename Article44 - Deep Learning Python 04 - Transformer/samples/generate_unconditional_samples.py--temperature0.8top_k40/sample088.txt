Don't trust me?
Trust him instead to save me

Don't trust me?
Don't trust me
Trust him

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden within
Open wounds hidden under my skin

Pain is real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Staring at me crying

[CHORUS]
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I sever myself from the world
and shut down completely
All together I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I'm hiding in the shadows again
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

"The Enemy Inside"

Inside the dating scene
One of the more twisted
versions of the drug
That if you wanna stay
You must mate with the black
And they took their turns
It's a matter of moments

You're letting your life slip away
While you're blowing out the fuse
You risk your pride
When you're trying to find a man
You're looking for a black but you find that there's one
who's black, that's the country
and that's the world

"Always Never"

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced?

I was raised in '67
By the greats
But in '67 they took our lives
By electing us to be
Soldiers
On deserted roads
To shoulder to shoulder with the wild
People.

When we weren't together
We were both learning to laugh
Again

I was raised in '67
By the greats
But in '67 they took our lives
By electing us to be
Soldier
On deserted roads
To shoulder to shoulder with the wild
People.

And Are You Experienced?

Yes, we all know the suspense
Catching the glee
In electing you as a follower

I was raised in '67
By the greats
But in '67 they took our lives
By electing us to be
Soldier
On deserted roads
To shoulder to shoulder with the wild
People.

"Jimmy"

What was it like to see,
The face of your own stability
When you faced the darkness of time
A scarred conscience
was exposed
Jimmy kept secrets
Even from yourself
As the viper sung
The dying verse
of your own self

Eleven and a half years
Since we last met
Our hearts have been pounding for months
How many lives have we lost
How many have we saved?

I want to see
Change come about
Today I am
Twenty-six and a half
Sitting here in peace

Eleven and a half years
Since we last met
Our hearts have been racing for months
How many lives have we lost
How many have we saved?

I want to see
Change come about
Today I am
Twenty-six and a half
Sitting here in peace

Underground music is getting so loud
It's getting so loud
Can you hear me?
The music is getting louder
It's getting so loud
Can't hear me?

Let it be
Never say the name of your friend
The music is getting louder
It's getting so loud
So can you hear me?

"Garden of Earthly Delights"

It's such an easy thing to go wrong
I know what will always be clear to see
I've always been wrong

I know what will always be clear to see
I've always been wrong

Garden of Earthly delights
Have you ever hated the way you looked
That wrinkled brow on your skin said, "You're wrong?
Look it dead down.
It's wrinkled brow on your skin, and you're gonna hate me."

Now I'm gonna miss you
Trying to believe
The brow in your skin is getting darker
You might not like it, but don't
Try and please don't
Remember I said I like the way you look
Now you can see it when I look away

I know what will
