Save the child

In the wake of tragedy
Reunite humanity

Forty-six per cent
Believe

"We should all be fighting
For the same thing
And fight like the rest of the world
Because there is nothing wrong with hatred
But don't you tell me 'hate is just', I know it's wrong
And I know I'm not the same as you

You can talk me into giving up
You can't take the fight
And I know I'm not the same as you

When I'm behind
You can't see, I'm right behind you
Take it as a threat too, a surprise attack
See how I fell in love with you?
You can't take the fight
In combat, you're the new one

You can't forget me
When I take my final breath
In a year or even less
You'll know why

I was waiting for someone
Who would lead me to believe
Through all the battles,
To shed innocent blood
And shine with you, a semblance
Still waiting for someone
Who would give me purpose
And help me break right through this slavery

"Blackwater Park"

Confessor
Of the tragedies in man
Lurking in the core of us all
The last dying call for the ever lost
Brief encounters, bleeding pain

Lepers coiled neath the trees
Dying men in bewildered soliloquies
Perversions bloom round the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic under the waning moon

It is the turning point
A pivotal turning point
That allows the one who bravely stands
To take back control

Centuries of tragedy
Addicted to the game
Breaking down walls of shame
Controlling complex, yet fragile desires
Can these be undone

The mother of all false starts
Saddest of all is the endless parade of sorrow

It's become so clear to see how
All you are as a whole
If you're not willing to face the bitter fight
You're in the dark about ending it all

[V:]
"This fatal meeting
Performs a miracle that will free me
As all humanity is saved
From this fate

The turning point is upon us
And when that moment comes
All we can do is set free
I can rise again

"Sleeping Giant"

[VI:]
"When I'm sleeping giant falling through
I hear the sobriety of speech

When I'm dreaming up dreams of conquering
I'm much wiser
While awake in the body is burning

I can recognize any movement or sound
As I'm falling through
I can recognize any length of time
As I'm waking up

Standing by the door
I'm greeted by the sound
Of falling stone
I hear the sobriety of speech

When I'm sleeping giant falling through
I hear the sobriety of speech

When I'm sleeping giant falling through
I hear the sobriety of speech

I can recognize any movement or sound
As I'm falling through
I can recognize any length of time

When I wanna dream again
Spinning round with ease
I'm loved and spread out

When I'm sleeping giant falling through
I hear the sobriety of speech

I can recognize any movement or sound
As I'm falling through
I can recognize any length of time

"Dream Eater"

At night I wake up with a memory
I hold onto the dark thread
Its edge around my neck
To pull the pieces from the sand
And restore confidence
into a man who's paralyzed

Cold sweat and fever
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the radar
Keep an eye on the wings of a forgotten bird

I dreamed of this feeling when I woke up
In a day and age
A dream that no longer lasts

I drill down inside the stone
Building walls that will keep him safe
And keeping him sane
I ask myself,
How come this feeling
Is so unfamiliar
And what can I do to help
