======================================== SAMPLE 64 ========================================
The momentary joy - the purest form of love

I fell in love with the dark
And the momentary sorrow
Has now returned to haunt me

Un-deniable dilemma
A pursuit of happiness
Or a pursuit of death

Passion and boldness
Leading one life at a time
Un-deniable dilemma

Moments of tragedy
Trapped in our hearts

A phantasm of our awareness
Stained by our fears

Rising and sinking
Into the deepest void

Confined and uninvited
In a setting where words are sacred
No one can see us
And where words are fate
We are everywhere

I - I don't know why I - I don't know why I
Can't- I must go on
Save my soul
Cause there's no turning back

A phantasm of our awareness
Stained by our fears

Rising and sinking
Into the deepest void

Confined and uninvited
In a setting where words are sacred
No one can see us
And where words are fate
We are everywhere

"Face Of Melinda"

By the turnstile beckons a damsel fair
The face of Melinda neath blackened hair
Hascome the lips of children forgotten
And smiled upon a temple of love

And as you walk through all your portraits
You will blend in, blend out
And face many a moment

By the turnstile beckons a damsel fair
The face of Melinda neath blackened hair
Has Come the lips of children forget
And smiled upon a temple of love

And as you walk through all your portraits
You will blend in, blend out
And face many a moment

By the turnstile beckons a damsel fair
The face of Melinda neath blackened hair
Has Come the lips of children forget
And smiled upon a temple of love

"Hex Omega"

A heart that feels no heat
ASHPHOLES WHO REST HERE
A dream that seems real

Now I'm getting sleepy
AND TESTING my will

AND TESTING my will

AND TESTING my will
AND TESTING my will
AND TESTING my will
AND TESTING my will

"Constant Motion"

Tunnel vision at blinding speed
Controlling my thoughts, obsessing me
Void of any uncertainty
Throughout my very soul

Lost illusions of mind control
Resisting all hope of letting go
Racing impulse of dark need
Drives me through the night

I'm hanging on the edge
AND TESTING my will

AND TESTING my will
AND TESTING my will
AND TESTING my will
AND TESTING my will
AND TESTING my will
AND TESTING my will
AND TESTING my will
AND TESTING my will
AND TESTING my will

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

Sacrifice my life
Neglect my kids and wife
All for you to be happy
All those sleepless nights
And countless fights to give you more
And then you say how dare that
I didn't write you back
I must be too good for you
I only care about myself

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

"Sacrificed Sons"

[Begins with samples from 9/11]

Walls are closing
Anxiously
Channel surfing
Frantically

Burning City
Smoke and fire
Planes we're certain
Faith inspired

No clues
A complete surprise
Who'll be
Coming home tonight

Heads all turning
Towards the sky
Towers crumble
Heroes die

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

Teach them what to think and act
