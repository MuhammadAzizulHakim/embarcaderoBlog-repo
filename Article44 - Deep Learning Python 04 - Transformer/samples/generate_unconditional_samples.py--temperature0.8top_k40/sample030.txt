It's not long yet, not long before we both know
Who we might meet
In the mall where I grew up
And in the morning when I find I have lost you
I keep an open heart
In sympathy I can't open my own mouth

But it's not long yet, not long before I know
Who we might meet
In the mall where I grew up
And in the morning when I find I have lost you
I keep an open heart
In sympathy I can't open my own mouth

But it's not long yet, not long before I know

And in the morning when I find I have lost you
I keep an open heart
In sympathy I can't open my own mouth

"Gravity Eyelids"

I don't know if I like it when you tell me that you love me
I don't know if you love me enough
I'm not the kind that you lay around where you don't talk to me
I'm not the kind that you'd want to stay inside
I'm not the kind who you'd want to go out and steal from me
I'm not the kind that you'd want to fall back to earth
I'm not the kind who you'd want to rape and kill and then watch your precious little piece of me slip away...

Gravity eyelids come down. They come down. They come down.

You don't know if you like it when I tell you this
I don't know if I love you enough
I'm not the kind that you lay around where you don't talk to me
I'm not the kind that you'd want to stay inside
I'm not the kind that you'd want to watch over me

"Herd Culling"

Son, go fetch the rifle now
I think there's something in the yard
I can see the herd is getting rattled
And the dogs are on their guard

Liar
Liar
Liar
Liar

Well, we came so fast
We had so much to do
In less than a second

We lost the fight
And the adrenaline's running high
The shot that killed pause right here

Liar
Liar
Liar
Liar

The militia are coming to take us down
There's a rifle waiting
There's a target on the ground
I can see the wolf is at the door
I've got a hole in my back
And there's nothing I can do
I'm down, I'm running out of fuel

Liar
Liar
Liar
Liar

Here comes the trigger
Here comes the trigger
Here comes the trigger

When I see the hole in my back
I'm gonna fire
When I see the wolf is at the door
I'm gonna fire
When I can see the wolf is at the door

"Flicker"

Pull the case out
Look around
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid of what's ahead
Don't be afraid of where I'm going

Never be afraid
Never be afraid
Never be afraid of what's ahead

"Under A Glass Moon"

â€œThrow that Bob Marley wanna-be motherfucker out
Let's dance dejectedly
One down, no less
One down, no less
One down, no less

Choirs on fire
Nothing is new here
Nothing is new here

She seems lost and witless
And judgmental
Her voice is dying
Not speaking to me

Nothing is new here
Nothing is new here

Choirs on fire
Nothing is new here
Nothing is new here

(I, I, I Love This Life)

[repeat]

Nothing is new here
Nothing is new here

(I, I, I Love This Life)

"The Start Of Something Beautiful"

Lost in the sky
Clouds roll by
And Uncle Tom's whistle blows

The ending of a story
Always changes
Every man dreams he knows

So many years to find the lake that brought us all here
I remember when the boys from Yankee Stadium
Tried to wave me home, and I said, "You can't do that to me.'
They were right - get a grip, get your grip.
I didn't have much left, so I went up to them, got hold.
I said, "I love you, Uncle Tom.
You're the
