======================================== SAMPLE 41 ========================================
It's so hard to get along
I don't know why I'm constantly on the road

[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".]
"I thought you could fix this place by injecting some kind of immortal fluid..."
"I didn't know that injecting drugs would make you immortal...
I just thought you could.... Fuck you."
"I didn't know that showers were so hot. I thought you could make your own clothes."
"I didn't know that you could use scissors to make your own flowers. I just thought you could."

So much for science
Now it's all but worthless
Don't you cry

I gave you my all
You still keep my car keys, tell me how you got 'em and more
All that I want is for you to keep changing soon

Only things that I desire
You get to keep the bag
And tell me how I should start again
After all, we've all been through this together.

Somebody has to go
It's time for a new beginning
Everyone else has to wait

Someone has to go
It's time for a new beginning
Everyone else has to wait

I'm waiting like a stone
I'm waiting for someone
I'm waiting for someone
I'm waiting for someone
I'm waiting for someone
I'm waiting for something new
I'm waiting for something new

"Deadwing"

This is not how I want it to end

This is not how I want it to end

This is not how I want it to end

This is not how I want it to end

Please don't cut me out
Cut me out of your life

This is not how I want it to end

This is not how I want it to end

This is not how I want it to end

So die trying
Fleeing the fight

This is not how I want it to end

This is not how I want it to end

" The Patient "

A vein in your neck
Numb pressure on the liquid
A warning light in the window
A way to happiness
With a cup of dark found
On a black and blue moon

This melancholy liquid
Helps calm the nerves
Like lemon juice

This is not how I want it to end

This is not how I want it to end

This is not how I want it to end

" Bohemian Rhapsody "

Bellow now, bellow now

Barely a second
Barely a second
Blank verse, verse gone
Cutting through, verse by verse

Hey, halo, verse one
Coming down, gonna go
Crawling up, crawling up
Stumbling all around,
Tear down my walls

Hey, halo, verse one
Coming down, gonna go
Crawling up, crawling up
Stumbling all around,
Tear down my walls

" Summer's gone astray
Ganja'd for all eternity
Knew it from the moment we arrived

But there's a right and wrong
In every home where I looked
And in every way, I thought she knew
Aseless child
With no one by my side by the bed ungrateful girl
Had us fooled again

Halo, round about
A fellow traveller in need
Heard a story of friendship between the gods
And wondered if there was something wrong
With what he thought was right

" Summer's gone astray
Ganja'd for all eternity
Knew it from the moment we arrived
But she never told the truth
She's given up hope
And let her story be a guide
She can't lose her hope

But there's a right and wrong
In every home where I look
And in every way, I thought she knew
Aseless child
With no one by my side by the bed ungrateful girl
Had us fooled again

" Silence Is The New Moon "

Silence is the new moon
established in law
Enacted by President Washington in Washington, D.C.
The law is clear and thorough
All branches
