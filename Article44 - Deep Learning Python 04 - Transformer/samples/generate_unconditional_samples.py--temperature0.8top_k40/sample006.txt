======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
Of all years....

I always feel the sting of failure
There's a certain satisfaction in knowing we made it this way
I felt that way towards the end
And still some days I linger in Ponce de Le√≥n's dark
Crest of the Americas

There's a story in which the princess dies
And Mother tells her tale
So I come to find that
She sacrificed her beauty to save him
And now she's faced her darkest hour
She never forgives

She didn't give up
She gave in
And she'll linger in her light
For all that she's lost

She couldn't lose
She couldn't be happy
There's a grace in her beauty
Said I would die with her
And I'd linger in her light

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make up runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my dreams have been wiped
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
Swim like a child inside my head

Some people I know well
Some don't make it to the top
There's a scar where all my dreams have been wiped
There's a god beneath my feet
I get electric shocks when I'm nervous
There's a place where all my dreams have been wiped
There's a God inside my head
I get heart palmtrees when I'm in pain
There's a love in your eyes somewhere

Some people I know well

"Jambi"

Here from the king's mountain view
Here from a wild dream come true
Feast like a sultan I guess
On treasures and flesh, never few

But I, I would wish it all away
If I thought I'd lose you soon

The devil and his had me down
In love with the dark side somehow
And I adore the dark side somehow

Now I've found my home in you

"The Moor"

The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays

And from afar it seemed so simple
Give me the things
I've been waiting for

I was so young and innocent
Still so young and free flowing
I felt so empty inside

Mortified souls reeking of sin
Alive as if one were me
And their guilt now inside me
As they sobriety failed me

I was so young and innocent
Still so young and free flowing
I felt so empty inside

I wanted so much more than I realized
I poured myself into all things that mattered
Such as a person, a idea, a prayer
Such as family or a dream
Such as life or death

So I took all my time
And walked away
Expecting you to live and give away all your secrets
Such a heavy burden now to us Catholics

I cannot help thinking
I've never been so moved by your laughter
And our shared humanity
Tells me how proud we all are

Pray they won't disappear
Through our collective haze
This collective haze is still growing

I can't help feeling
I've never been so moved by your laughter
And our shared humanity
Tells me how proud we all are

Pray they won't disappear
Through our collective haze
This collective haze will get even deeper

Sick of the misery we're living
The sick of the boredom
The sick of the boredom
The sick of the boredom

"Great Expectations"

I got a new baby today
It's a present that will stay with me forever

I got a place in a new house
It's going to be all about him
There's nothing I can do for him

I got a place in a new house
It's going to be all about him
There's nothing I can do for him

I got a place in a new house
It's going to be all about him
There's nothing I can do for him

I got a better life ahead
