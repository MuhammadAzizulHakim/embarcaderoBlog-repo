======================================== SAMPLE 59 ========================================
We know who the killer is
And we pray to him who lost his faith

Blood...Heresy...Beliefs
He's our Father's will
Blood...Heresy...Beliefs
He's our Father's will

"Still Day Beneath The Sun"

There is a light that hits the gloom around
Shows the footprints round this grave
Dried up roses scattered on the mound
Honouring the one engraved

Will ever the morning
Carry away
The souls of those for whom we cry

Leaving, grieving
Seeking, meeting
Binding, unwinding
Sighing, "you"

Still day beneath the sun
Asking you who is the one
And when the day is late
We know who must forever wait

Black procession through the narrow aisles
Another's gone for all to see
Near the site for one who lost his trials
Near the scene of one of our great tragedies
Near the site for one who lost his trials

"Patterns In The Ivy 2"

Without you I cannot confide in anything
The hope is pale designed in light of dreams you bring
Summer's gone, the day is done soon comes the night
Biding time, leaving the line and out of sight

One moonlit shadow on the wall
Disrupted in its own creation
Veiled in the darkness of this fall
Is this the end-manifestation

It runs in me, your poison seething in my veins
This skin is old and stained by late September rains
A final word from me would be the first for you
The rest is long but I'll go on inside and through

One moonlit shadow on the wall
Disrupted in its own creation
Veiled in the darkness of this fall
Is this the end-manifestation

It's not like you homeboy
The cold season wipes away the shame
Homeboy down in Wales is back again
Unbind your scrawny frame for the cold season

One moonlit shadow on the wall
Disrupted in its own creation
Veiled in the darkness of this fall
Is this the end-manifestation

It's not like you homeboy
The cold season wipes away the shame
Homeboy down in Wales is back again
Unbind your scrawny frame for the cold season

"The Moor"

The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays

Weary from what might have been ages
Still calm with my mind at peace
Would I prosper or fall, drain the past
The lapse of the moment took it's turn

I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death-mask at birth
The hands of God, decrepit and thin
Cold caress and then nothing
I left the mound behind
Fifteen alike have passed me by
All of them belonging to me
Though some were so young
And some were so old

I made amends with them all
Took what I had and turned it over

I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death-mask at birth
The hands of God, decrepit and thin
Cold caress and then nothing
I left the mound behind

I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death-mask at birth
The hands of God, decrepit and thin

"Like A Virgin"

Like a virgin, without a guide
Fascination and violence rule the day
Like the worst of ways to get through the day

I was shivering from the coldest caress
I was covered in sweat and taste
I waited in the coldness of winter's darkness

I was covered in snow from the frost
For a while I thought I'd never leave this place
But now they see the light inside of me
Like a wound that grows in trust
Saving strength from hatred
We seek to understand
Like a martyr fighting to save his life

Like a wound that grows in trust
Searing strength from hate
We seek to understand
Like a martyr fighting to save his life

"Anna Lee"

Helpless child
They invite you into their homes
By the way, they don't mind
If you're not there yet
They will take just the medicine
Tellingly, they ask for your name
For the name of a woman killed in a drive to get back home

Never enough for them
They know what they want and more
