"In Formaldehyde"

Dust in the kitchen
Coffeepot
Microdots

Now we are coasting
Talking less
Breathing stress

Somewhere inside
I have died
So I will lie
In formaldehyde
People walk
Through my insides

When I get out of here
I get a plastic vase
And you get to keep the car

Or do you want me to stay ?
The things that I have to say
You've heard it all anyway

Send me to sleep
You always could
Fatherhood

Tie up loose ends
Make it stop
Forget me not

And would you really mind
If I told you a millionth time
The story of my decline ?

You never said a word
You're talking about palates
You're talking about questions
And I can't seem to remember what those were

You never said a word
You're talking about medals
You're talking about faith
Things that I have to say
You've heard it all anyway

Send me to sleep
You always could
Fatherhood

Tie up loose ends
Make it stop
Forget me not

And would you really mind
If I told you a millionth time
The story of my decline ?

"It Will Rain For A Million Years"

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Slaughter
And are still to this day
I remember when the sky was blue
The first rain lashed the Midwest
The Midwest was in for a wild day

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Slaughter
And are still to this day
I remember when the sky was blue
The sky was blue to this day

Flying high
ets fell
The crescent moon saw the day
With a parting of the ways
I was raised in a free world
Nowhere was my freedom denied
I boarded a freighter
The sun beat down the sky
And for a while
Things seemed so new
I felt so new

"Fear Inoculum"

Immunity, long overdue
Contagion, I exhale you
Naive, I opened up to you
Venom and mania
Now, contagion, I exhale you

The deceiver says, he says
You belong to me
You don't wanna breathe the light of the others
Fear the light, fear the breath
Fear the others for eternity
But I hear them now, inhale the clarity
Hear the venom, the venom in
What you say inoculated
Bless this immunity
Bless this immunity

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Enumerate all that I'm to do
Calculating steps away from you
My own mitosis
Growing through division from mania

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Forfeit all control
You poison, you spectacle
Exorcise the spectacle
Exorcise the malady
Exorcise the disparate
Poison for eternity
Purge me and evacuate
The venom and the fear that binds me

Your veil now, lift away
I see you runnin'
Deceiver chased away
A long time comin'

"Pneuma"

We are spirit
Bound to this flesh
We go around one foot nailed down
We're bound to reach out and beyond
This flesh become Pneuma

We are will and wonder
Bound to remember one day
When we stood shoulder to shoulder with you

Spirit guide, guide, guide
Settle down for the ride
To the other side of the world
To witness the beauty and the mystery

"Prodigal"

I don't know whose side I'm on
I don't think that I belong round here
If I left the stage would that be wrong?

I tried to find myself a better way
I got religion but I went astray
They took my money and I lost my faith
