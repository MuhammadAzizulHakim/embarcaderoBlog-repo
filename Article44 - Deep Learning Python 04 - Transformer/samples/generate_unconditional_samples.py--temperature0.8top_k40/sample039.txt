[Instrumental]

[VI. Ready]

I know this can't end there
I know it can't end there
Can we mend the wounds of discord?
In the heat of the moment, of uncertainty
I know this can't end there
I know it can't end there
Can we mend the wounds of discord?

[VII. Ready]

[VIII. Ready]

I know this can't end there
I know it can't end there
Can we bring things back to balance?
When we choose to go back
To balance the spoils of war
That is to say, we will
When we choose to go back
To our Fathers, our Mothers
We are choosing to go back

We are choosing to go back

[IX. Ready]

[X. Principles]

When I hear someone talk about principles
I know they mean nothing to me
Well let me tell you something:
There is something in these principles
That I would never abandon
Even if my heart was broken

When I hear someone talk about principles
I know they are lying
Well, if they knew my heart was broken

We all long for a better day
It is our hope
Before we cry "Naive"
It is our hope

When I hear someone talk about principles
I know they are lying
Well, if they knew my heart was broken

There is something that I would never abandon
Even if my heart was broken

There is something that I would never abandon
Even if my heart was broken

[XI. The Pursuit Of Truth]

Mothers for their children
Husbands for their wives
Martyrs for the kingdom
Fighting for your life
A soldier for his country
A junkie for the high
Teachers for their students
Useless helpless victims

Every day a pound of flesh is thrown
Plunging into the black
No one seems to listen

Watching his stepfather
Dying from a heart attack
He was the one
Who saved his son from hopelessness

Every day a pound of flesh is thrown
Plunging into the black
No one seems to listen

Watching his stepfather
Dying from a heart attack
He was the one
who saved his son from hopelessness

Silence reaching for the skies
Watching his stepfather
Dying from a heart attack

"On The Backs Of Angels"

Standing on the backs of angels
Destined to create
Mounting the attack
While heroes carry your weight

We spiral towards disaster
Survival fading faster

Riding out the wave
Content to feed off the machine
Bleeding us to death
The new American dream

You're blinded by your hunger
Beware your days are numbered

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

Blurring the lines drawn in between
What is right and what is wrong
Victims on the radar string us along

We're on to your agenda
The dead end road to nowhere

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

"Build Me Up, Break Me Down"

Today I will be your savior
Tomorrow â€’ a demon
You crave my erratic behavior
And watch my every move

Obsession at all cost
You'll be the death of me
Broken and torn apart
Why can't you let me be?

You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces
I crash and burn
I never learn
I'm your guilty addiction

Build me up
Break me down

Tonight I am the new messiah, breaking me down
Until I can't forget you
You're my burden and your guilt
My private test, your test, your pride

It's not enough for me
I'm not enough
For you I'm the test, your soul's-

I can't take anymore
All of you are nothing but garbage
Clean and flourishing
I'm your guilty addiction

Build me up
Break me down

You build me up
You break me down
