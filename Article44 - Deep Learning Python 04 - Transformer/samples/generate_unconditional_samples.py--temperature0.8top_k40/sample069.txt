I don't wanna be alone
I don't want to feel alone
And nobody knows what they see
When they walk through my door

Every night I'm praying for strength
Every night I'm praying for hope

[Whispered:]
You beautiful girl
Isn't she your own?
You're the embodiment of femininity

I can't keep away from you
And night is always darkest
As you walk through my door

Every night I'm praying for strength
Every night I'm praying for hope

[Whispered:]
You beautiful girl
Isn't she your own?
You're the embodiment of femininity

I can't keep away from you
And night is always darkest
As you walk through my door

Every night I'm praying for strength
Every night I'm praying for hope

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide and attempt to swallow
Re-enter a world full of pain
Every waking hour
A thousand pain insecurities
Step onto a railway track
Lighting up the sky

Empty house, no one here to stay
Nothing you to say
Surrounded by fear, no one here to stay

Riding out the wave, treading water
Never enough, every waking hour
A thousand pain insecurities
Step onto a railway track
Lighting up the sky

"Cold And Ugly"

Feeling all my heart can take
Feeling all my veins go
Black and red
I'm feeling like I'm living in fear

Don't tell me you wanted me
Don't tell me you thought of me
I won't, I swear I won't
They'll never, will never, let me be a voice for change
I'm feeling like I'm living in fear

Cold and ugly
Feeling all my organs burning
Came out
Burnt out the skin
Skin is burning
Dried up the colors I've been using
Ugly as we are
They'll never, will never, let me be a voice for change
I'm feeling like I'm living in
Ridiculous as I am lazy
Keep your head up
You're the judge for letting me be

Don't tell me you wanted me
Don't tell me you thought of me
I won't, I swear I won't
They'll never, will never, let me be a voice for change
I'm feeling like I'm living in
Ridiculous as I am lazy
Keep your head up
You're the judge for letting me be

" Sunshine Day"

I received a beautiful smile
As a stranger walked by
He said, "Have you seen the angel in the window?"
I said, "No, I haven't..."
Then he turned and looked away

Then he looked back at me

Now he's alone in the room
He's holding my heart
He's kissing me
And I'm breathing heavily
He's forcing himself into me
I'm totally broken

But I hear him through the window
I hear the story behind the stained glass
And I can see the hurt behind the window
I have forgiven him
And I pray he forgives me

I see the scars he's left on me
I feel the pull of the traffic pass for now
I see the scars on my racing heart
I ask myself, "Could this be the end?"
"Could this be the end?"
"Yeah, it could be"

I want what's left
What's left of me
Will be sold as a gift
Tired bones beneath the wheel
Pale horse rider through the mud
Seductive black eye in the window box
Pale horse rider through the mud
Seductive black eye in the window box

I want what's left
What's left of me
Will be sold as a gift
Tired bones beneath the wheel
Pale rider through the mud
Seductive black eye in the window box
Pale horse rider through the mud
Seductive black eye in the window box

"Way Out Of Here"

Out at the train tracks I dream of escape
But a song comes onto my iPod
And I realize it's getting late

I can't take the staring
It's so hard to walk away
And I don't want to wait any longer
