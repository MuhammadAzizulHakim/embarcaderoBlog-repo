======================================== SAMPLE 66 ========================================
The big machines are gone, gone and gone
And no-one seems to care
Chemical harvest is done
No-one is dead and forgotten
The polluting air
And the billionaires
Who have made their fortune in this crooked system

The big machines are gone, gone and gone
And no-one seems to care
Chemical harvest is done
No-one is dead and forgotten
The polluting air
And the billionaires
Who have made their fortune in this crooked system

Your mouth should be wide open to show where you came from
No-one is dead and forgotten
Chemical harvest is done
No-one is dead and forgotten
The polluting air
And the billionaires
Who have made their fortune in this crooked system

You can swim against the current
You can walk against the current
No-one is dead and forgotten
The polluting air
And the millionaires
Who have made their fortune in this crooked system

"Forty-Six & 2"

Join in my, join in my child,
And listen, I've been digging through my old numb shadow...

My shadow's been nothing but shadow,
It's been the foundation stone for all my problems
I can't break through now, I simply cannot!
I'm reaching for the cold blood, I'm reaching for the cold blood,
It's the foundation stone for all my problems!

If I die tomorrow
I'm reaching for the cold blood
The foundation stone for all my problems!

"Sever's a Matter of Degree"

Current state of affairs
A head would explode unless he could not go
Home is the only shelter
Waves of water vapor in the form of sweat

A knife wound deep over the back of my neck
Tearfuls of hope wash me from my wounds

There's no turning back
No turning back now
No turning back now

Turning back is no turning back
No turning back now
No turning back now

"Patterns In The Ivy 2"

[I. Winding Rigaija]

She dreams of her new life
There's a boy she trusts
She dresses in boy clothes
They invite him to stay
And when she sings a lullaby
He beats the crap waiting for me

I can't shake the memory
I'm breaking down in bed
And the word is waiting for me

[II. Full Circle]

She has ambitions of her own
He's lost his head at school
Is there someone who will line his pockets
And tell him to shut up

[III. The Inevitable Summer]

She tells me stories
Sets her down for a walk
And gets up at night
To find the people there
She's got a room at the top of the stairs
She's got all the people there
Who are her eyes seeing
And she's got one more name
To fill his empty glass

[IV. The Crimson Sunset]

She tells me lies
Sits at the barstool
Is everyone waiting for me

[V. Eggs and Seafood]

I'm greeted by a stranger
A young man without a face
I see a Crimson Sunset sign
It's my turn
To check in with the future

I. STARTED APRIL DEEP
I. STARTED APRIL DEEP

Now that I've started,
I know what I want to be
No matter what
I will never be a voice for change
And I know what I want to be

Nothing is sacred
And changing is hard
But learn from mistakes
And stand strong

II. FIGHTING TO FALL

Today I am fighting for my life
Tomorrow I am fighting for the light
And fighting for the freedom to be who I am meant to be

I. Fight to find a better way
Tomorrow I am fighting for the life I've always known
I. Fight to find a new life
I need the peace of mind and peace of mind

I. Fight to find a new life
Tomorrow I am fighting for the light and the freedom to be who I am meant to be
I. Fight to find a new life
I need the peace of mind and the freedom to be who I am meant to be

I aint no fight no sir
I have always known
I always will be
