======================================== SAMPLE 51 ========================================
[I. THE REST]
I've spent so long questioning my own sanity
culminating
Wondering when this tug of war will end.
When truth will let us know.

Nothing I say
Can keep her from leaving
And nothing I say
Can keep her from leaving

[II. DEEP IN HEAVEN]

[Instrumental]

[III. THE WASTELAND]

We're left behind
Like all the others
When we look to you
Our guilt and our pain
Is gone now

Nothing is left
But all that remains
Is the haunt for the wicked
And all that remains is the dark and the cold

Nothing is left
But all that remains
Is the haunt for the wicked
And all that remains is the dark and the cold

"In The Mist She Was Standing"

Hold your fear in check my dear
It's all an illusion
She's holding back
He's railing against the wind
And she's railing against the moon

You look but never see
The night's not so bad here
In the north
The coldness of your existence
The edge of the self
So feared the other
And all your doubting has vanished

Nothing is left
But all that remains
Is the haunt for the wicked
And all that remains is the dark and the cold

"In The Mist She Was Standing"

No more fighting
No more losing

You're honor's not enough for you
You're pride's not enough for you
You're mind's glove undone
So you bide your time
With your fate resigned to fate

You're honor's not enough for you
You're pride's not enough for you
You're mind's glove undone
So you bide your time
With your fate resigned to fate

"Blackwater Park"

Confessor
Of the tragedies in man
Lurking in the core of us all
The last dying call for the ever lost
Brief encounters, bleeding pain

Lepers coiled neath the trees
Dying men in bewildered soliloquies
Perversions bloom round the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic under the waning moon

It is the autumn of man
The fall of man

Constant heart failure
Abandoned from any hope of redemption
Addicted to the violence of his world
A true believer of his master
Unwelcome presence within his walls

It is the fall of man
The fall of man

The fall of man

"Heart in Hand"

"Manifestation"

Inside the coffin
The final destiny
Poured into the mire
Given form to be gone by

A lamentable sadness
Smashed beneath the pale of triumph
Age and wealth brought about by craving

A darkened temple
Waits on the fringe of mania
Faint flickering of life born in his blindness

A crestfallen moon under the waning moon
Spin a common descent

Signalling the end of a quest
A manifest for his lost

Heart in hand
Manifestation

Waits are overdue
Time to unfold
Once the great task has been fulfilled

Waits are overdue
Time to unfold
Once the great task has been fulfilled

Messenger of truth
Killing in the name of spite
A tyrant's a tyrant
He will only shatter
When his tyrant is gone

Passion for the cause
Heart in hand

Signalling the end of a quest
A manifest for his lost

Heart in hand

Waits are overdue
Time to unfold
Once the great task has been fulfilled

Messenger of truth
Killing in the name of spite
A tyrant's a tyrant
He will only shatter
When his tyrant is gone

Passion for the cause
Heart in hand

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden within
Open wounds hidden under my skin

Pain is real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Staring at me crying

I do not recognize the place I've wandered
All my questions and perplexities are erased
Like a cloud that's seen my hurt

The sightlessness that makes me feel so cold
Inside I am a shadow and nothing is the same

I admit that I am stuck
In this hopelessness, isolation from the world
Outside I am the one who died

The tongue
