======================================== SAMPLE 99 ========================================
I've got a voice inside of me that'll make you say
All your prayers answered
There's something you must hear

<|endoftext|>

"Space Transmission"

You must listen very carefully to what I have to say. Your behavior toward me cannot be tolerated.
There is something you must understand.
There is something you must remain.

There is nothing I can do for you to begin with
and there is nothing I can do for you to end.

Perversions of my love for you must end
There is nothing I can do for you to begin with
and I do not love you at all
do you really need to begin?

There is something you must understand

"The Disease"

Every morning I wake up, feel the sun coming on
Every day I roll the dice and hope that one day I will return

I'm not sick or anything like that
I'm just a bunch of lazy kids
Sometimes I feel stupid
And the pills that I've been taking keep getting weaker
They keep getting stranger by the minute
So it's time to make my amends

I'm not gonna miss a beat
Look me in the eye, I'm not scared
I'm just a memory
I hate to break down and leave you
But don't tell me you thought of me that way

Every day that I feel unwell
Every day that I sleep sound like me
Every day that I dream of you
It's time for our last
Before we cry it's time to take our final

Before we sleep that feeling away
Before we dream of you inside of me
It's time for our last
Before we sleep that feeling away

"She's Moved On"

You're losing yourself there
She knows it's time to move on
Her life has changed in three steps
360 degrees darkness surrounding you
Pull yourself together
One thing is for certain
You're moving on
Now is your time to make your amends

260 degrees love this place that I
am moving on into the future
You're holding back on the light
You're going down a road that I
will move on to make my amends

What I'm seeing now is not what it's been
It's shifting again
this time from feeling uninspired
to seeing
what it'll be like to move onto.

"Perfect Strangers"

Nothing like this has ever been
And I'm looking forward to the chance to try
Out some of my friends
Locked inside of their own minds
Who will give them a glimpse of who they really are

Nothing is new here underneath
It's a dangerous world out there
And it's spreading far and wide

Nothing is new here underneath
It's a dangerous world out there
And it's spreading far and wide

"Fear Inoculum"

Some will describe this as a "new normal"
Others will call it a turning point

Some will call it the counter-clockwise move
Others will call it the mare out there

Some will even call it the butterfly out there
one that will ride in reverse

These are just a number of my ways
Some will fly in circles and some will go right off the bat
and still others will be perfectly still
and still another hopeful would emerge

"�ὐτοῦ

Fear is an attitude
Mobility is a method
Of gaining balance
Of letting go of shame

In a downward spiral
We're constantly searching
Where once I thought I believed
I'm moving on

Now I know why I've been
So surprised at how well I've
