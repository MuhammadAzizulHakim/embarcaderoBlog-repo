======================================== SAMPLE 58 ========================================
I am a stranger in and of itself
No love for dissent
No love for dogma
You are flawed as all of us
Yet we harbor our faith in you

You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I take the lead as he chases his son home
As our seaman slips away

"Barstool Warrior"

In a dark and lonely corner
Of a time-worn dockside inn
Resting beneath the cold winter night

When the summer's fading
Through
In the empty dockside inn
Again the chill of November
Rising up through the coldest skies

The barstool warrior
Knew it from the moment he saw the red
that day
assaults him with unfair pride
Defenders of the weak will do what they can to stop
him from reaching his full potential
this is all that remains

"Nepenthe"

Hope will never die out of thirst
Heart will always be free
Yellowing and waning
Nothing now is sacred
End of a life span

Hope will never fail
My hope will never fail
My hope will never fail

Hope will never fail
Hope will never fail
Hope will never fail

"Constant Motion"

Tunnel vision at blinding speed
Controlling my thoughts, obsessing me
Void of any uncertainty
Throughout my very soul

Lost illusions of mind control
Resisting all hope of letting go
Racing impulse of dark desire
Drives me through the night

I try to shut it down
It leaves me in the dust
No matter what I've found
I can never get enough

Frantic actions of insanity
Impulsive laced profanity
Long for elusive serenity
Way out of my control

Traveling through both space and time
(Out of body, out of mind)
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
(I can't let up, I can't let go)
Can't stop this flame from burning
Forever more
Into the night
Blistering

Traveling through both space and time
(Out of body, out of mind)
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
(I can't let up, I can't let go)
Can't stop this flame from burning
Can't stop the wheels from turning

Traveling through both space and time
(You get yours, and I got mine)
Out of control
Your wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
(I can't let up, I can't let go)
Can't stop this flame from burning
Can't stop the wheels from turning

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Cut myself open wide
And put my foot on the pedal

Now what's left is all I've left
Under the covers
What's left is what it's all means

Sometimes I feel like a rebel
Sometimes I'm just a cog in the machine
What it takes to make me want to hate
Is another cry for help
A heart for one more child

Sometimes I feel like I'm turning away
Sometimes I'm just a cog in the machine
What it takes to make me want to despise
Is another fight, another test I go to die

I'm finding courage in what I'm shedding
I'm shedding courage in hating
I'm turning away
Sometimes I feel like I'm turning away

I pissed off all along
But I'm still basking the pride
I'm turning away

Sometimes I feel like I'm turning away
Sometimes I'm just a waste of fluid
What it takes to make me want to despise
Is another test I go to die

I'm learning to live with my demons
I'm turning away
Some of these feelings will surface
Some will atrophy upon reflection
A waste of time, a waste of time
Counseling and therapy are not the answer

Sometimes I'm finding comfort in what I'm doubting
Sometimes I
