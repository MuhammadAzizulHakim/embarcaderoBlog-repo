======================================== SAMPLE 31 ========================================
Ported in by black
Vibrant colours reflected in the tapestry
Patterns of her fabric
Swathed in sorrows and light
She turned and faced us for the first time
Her laced coat held all her scars
She spoke of the end and meekly turned away
From faces of tenderness
To fevered minds
She had us tremble

She then turned and faced us for the first time
Her laced coat held all her scars
She spoke of the end and meekly turned away
From faces of tenderness
To fevered minds

Wept for days lost
Wept for days

And for once in a while
We don't care
We're here
We're kissing again

"Way Out Of Here"

Out at the train tracks I dream of escape
But a stranger's presence is another story
And I'm turning away

I'm turning away
Turning away from further
Onward glance
It's not much of a turn
if at all

But it seems so clear now
It's easier to walk away
than look it in the eye

Maybe I'll one day reach out and take
All of humanity
And maybe not
I'm too blind to see

I'm reaching for the rhyme
And I'm reaching for the meaning of it all
even if it's just a dream
I'm reaching for the rhyme
And I'm reaching for the meaning of it all
even if it's just a dream

I'm reaching for the rhyme
And I'm reaching for the meaning of it all
even if it's just a dream
I'm reaching for the meaning of it all
even if it's just a dream
I'm reaching for the meaning of it all

"Pale Blue Dot"

It's a color meadow full of petals
Where the years went by
And I made my mistakes
That bitter feeling stay behind

Yeah, I'm staring down the barrel
It's a beautiful silver lining
It helps to ease the pain
Even if it's for a moment
As I'm pouring myself
Behind the wheel I'm racing
To the moon
I tried the eye, it felt old
But I never thought to bring it back

"Futile"

Ruby won't show
Her heart is in your hands
and she's lost all hope
Hold on for one more breath

You're staring right past me
Every time you look away
It's because you're feeling invisible
The more times you strike out
The less time you have left

You're reaching for the words in your paper
The more time you have left
The less time you have in your heart

Say
you're staring right past me
Every time you look away
It's because you're feeling invisible
The more times you draw
The less time you have left

Say
you're staring right past me
Every time you look away
It's because you're feeling invisible
The more time you bring
The less time you have

Say
you're staring right past me
Every time you look away
It's because you're invisible
The more time you bring
The less time you have

Say
you're staring right past me
Every time you look away
It's because you're invisible
The more time you bring
The less time you have

"Afterlife"

Lying in my bed
Am I the last one of my kind
Who's afraid of dying
But who's vain enough to try and knows what I'm worth

I'm out of hope
I'm in need of salvation
I'm in need of eternal life
I'm in need of salvation
But who is saved when all my lies are exposed

Then a voice rang out
A world was born
All the promises I made
All the lies said and done

And soon the darkness was gone
And my light received
A world was born
All the hope I had, never worth the wait
Feeling strangers staring my way
I opened my eyes wide
And saw the truth in them all

He chose me
With the dirt and the fear
I was chosen
With the lies and the hate
I was chosen
With the dark and the wary stare
That gave me the strength to carry on
