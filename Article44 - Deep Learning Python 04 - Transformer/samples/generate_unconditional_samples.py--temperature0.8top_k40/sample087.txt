======================================== SAMPLE 87 ========================================
They're not getting much smarter

Life is good until we kill ourselves
But we're living in a wasteland
Prodigiously
While we reeled over a laughing Bushido

It's no laughing matter
Hope is dead and buried
The undertow is thick and heavy
No gain for humanity in despair

A whining moron from a family
With a sweet tooth and a scarlet letter

Our hypocrites in Washington
And in union with God
Worked all they can to make you wait
as long as you can't see me
They are the ones
Who will change my mind

Moments lapse
I'm paralyzed
My eyes are half closed
My only friend in the country
So relax
I'm paralyzed
My eyes are half closed

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm pulled into the still
The moment I was designed to be

I'm left behind
Like all the others
Some fall for you
It doesn't make much difference if they do

She changes every time she sees me
By summer it was all gone - now she's moved on
She called me every other day
And she said I'm sorry - I'm sorry if I'm not you.

"The Nostalgia Factory"

A Caterpillar wingtip flies out the window
The rain is pouring down...
The curtains are closed again
The curtains are closed again

I keep my folding skein
I keep my book
I keep my pen
I keep my mood gauge
I keep her number
She keeps his heart in the land

When I'm down I get up
When I'm up, we go see you
When she's down, we move left

We stayed the course
When she stays the course
She keeps his heart in the land

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make up runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my dreams seem real
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams seem real
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are real
I got a brook where all my dreams can't go
I got a place where all my dreams are real
I got a place where all my dreams are real
I got a brook where all my dreams can't go

"This Is No Rehearsal"

How many children did I bring into this world?
How many did I lose in the shopping arcade?

This is no rehearsal - play it back
and throw things at the screen
This is no rehearsal - somebody
interpret this for me

And still I remember how I dressed him this morning
And then he was gone - stolen, my only one

"Baby Dream In Cellophane"

I am - in my pram
Look you - I'm so new I am - sleeping there
Underneath the stairs

If I wanted to find out
What would it take?
For me to get back home again

Under ordinary circumstances
The door is open wide
Take my hand and we'll fly

Inside my baby dream
It's so surreal

I don't wanna be old
And all my friends
And all my lonely days
