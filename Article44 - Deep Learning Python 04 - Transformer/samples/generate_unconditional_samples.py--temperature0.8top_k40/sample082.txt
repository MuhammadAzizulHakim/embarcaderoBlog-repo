======================================== SAMPLE 82 ========================================
Lord knows
We're bound to make some
And promise to pay
When debts are past our ability to deal
Can't they see
It happens all the time
In our lazy, destructive, selfish ways

Every day I write
Every day I play
Every day I cry

"I feel now like Christine Keeler
Because I knew her well."

"Halo"

I hear the cries
There's blood on the ground
There Liaits on the ground
I hear the dead
There is no one to save
When there is too much pain
There is too much pain

I hear the cries
There's blood on the ground
There Liaits on the ground
I hear the dead
There is no one to save
When there is too much pain
There is too much pain

"Lightning Shifter"

[INT. Gabriel's Hideout - Night]

[Arhys:]
As fearless leader of the Five Great Treasures
and beloved as he is free
I remember the fearless man once wept for our murdered savior.
And as his light finally fell on us
we could not resist him alone.

[Faythe:]
I knew the day had come
And there was no turning back
As our blood had run cold
With the threat of eternal damnation
She would step in
And call our lives back to life

[Gabriel:]
Today is a day of pain
And a day of trial
For our dreams have died
Down on the earth, in this embrace

we could not resist him alone

[Arabelle:]
I remember the day was night
And there was no turning back
As our pride had died
Typical for us

As our blood had run cold
With the threat of eternal damnation
She would step in
And call our lives back to life

[Arabelle:]
I'm afraid not.
Not long ago there was a time and place
You too possessed the same desires as Faythe.

But now that we know all this
There has been no sin, no betrayal
No damnation, no fights
So light withstood
Earth's might and was called upon
To save humanity.

[Earthquake:]
The words stuck in my throat
My throat's got a hold of mine
Holding me here
And I can't leave this place
This place I so often look down upon

Nothing I've done
Can keep her from leaving
And this will only make things worse
She'll keep waiting for no one
And no one is there to care

Nothing I've done
Can keep her from leaving
And this will only make things worse
She'll keep waiting for no one
And this will only make things worse
She'll keep waiting for no one
And this will only make things worse

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor
I asked you to erase all but the name on
My knife
You took the name of the man
But no-one will listen

Un-read, un-read
Why would I care?
I've done nothing wrong
I can't forgive
