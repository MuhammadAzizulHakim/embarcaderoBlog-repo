======================================== SAMPLE 7 ========================================
My friends whose lives I've touched
I wish they'd never left
And maybe it takes longer to reach out and understand

Some of you are finding peace of mind
Some of you are suffering from depression
And one of them I am
may have lost all that I've become

[II. Fundamental Change]

To see a change in the light of day
As I navigate the dark and dark
I've never been more envious

[III. Ready]

Selfishly serve the common good
And stand as the eyes of the nation
While the rest of the world watches
Watching us from a safe distance

See a change has come
In the way I think and feel
Seeing through my mistakes
Over the past few years
I've seen the light
I feel the sun is burning brighter
And life has become a burden for me

[IV. Ready]

Selfishly serve the common good
And stand as the eyes of the nation
While the rest of the world watches
Watching us from a safe distance

Our minds are wired to adapt
When faced with a choice between abandoning our creed and embracing the gift of life
Ready

Helpless souls inside
There is no absolution
For those who mourn for lost innocence

Responsible thinkers
Take their time
Finding the words
For those who are too paralyzed to face reality

IV. Ready

Helpless souls inside
There is no absolution
For those who mourn for lost innocence

"Way Out Of Here"

Out at the train tracks I dream of escape
But a stranger's hand has me tumbling
To and fro

Beyond the comfort zone
I'll be met with horror and terror
As I reach for my life

Over the water, I swim in the face of the unknown

Sleeping with the dead
Isolation reaching to new depths
Between the addict and the addict's hatred

Out with the dead
Isolation reaching to new depths
Between the addict and the addict's hatred

"Pale Blue Dot"

I am in a lake of fire
And my mother is a junkie

Every home burns
Everytime I turn on the light

I was given a map
It shows where I've been all my lives
But I never got the impression that I's lived here

I'm in a lake of fire
And my mother is a junkie
Every home burns
Everytime I turn on the light

Day light blue sky
She said there's a place left behind
That I could live
But she never said a word

I'm in a lake of fire
And my mother is a junkie
Every home burns
Everytime I turn on the light

"No Quarter"

Lie down, inform me
Of all that we have seen
And of what has been revealed
This is the year of the jive

No quarter for the seaman's fire
No quarter for the king's fire
No quarter for the jive

There is a fever pushing me through the roof
It's getting stillier
And I don't seem to be growing

Why can't we not be sober

I know the pride we feel
For every loss
Is a blessing we can live with
It's a given the seaman's fire will fly

There is a bitterness crawling with the rain
And I don't seem to be getting better

I know the pride we feel
For every loss
Is a blessing we can live with
It's a given the seaman's fire will fly

No quarter
Lie down, inform me
Of all that we have seen and of what has been revealed
This is the year of the seaman's fire

No quarter

"The Rover / Achilles Last Stand / The Song Remains The Same"

[I. The Rover]

[Instrumental]

[II. Achilles Last Stand]

It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turn to you you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To sing the same songs again
Oh how we wished we weren't so
So full of it

I can't remember the innocence that tickled
My sweet almond head

As I drive on through the hills
The distant memory fades on
Recording all my sins on tape
I'm through with my narcotics

Without pause,
Discard your disarray
The sound of music
Moving through the air
Your body is melting down
Uprooted by reservations
And fueled by
