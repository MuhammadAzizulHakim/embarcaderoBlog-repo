And now they know what they know

We are all falling
Shivering, wandering
Numbed, bound
By the fear that binds me

Ravenskill
A sickening sight
Blinded by my sins
They see in me
And they know what they know

We are all falling
Shivering, wandering
Numbed, bound
By the fear that binds me

"Pure Narcotic"

You keep me waiting
You keep me alone in a room full of friends
You keep me hating

This world is breaking down
My thoughts are turning
Dripping with hope
My heart is pounding
Why can't we live our life alone?

Pure Narcotic
Sickening
I'm losing control
I'm red all over again

You keep me waiting
You keep me alone in a room full of friends
You keep me hating
You keep me thinking of you
It's sordid, bloodstained and cold
Your thoughts are sorting me out
Though I may not know you

"Random Shit"

Quote:
"Fuck leave school tomorrow
Because you're so gay
And listen to the shit you say
You don't even know the fuck about pornography
And watch what you say on your TV
You look like a pharaoh

Just another 25 Cent
Another man behind

This world is growing cold
My body is breaking down
Why can't we die alone?
In a room full of friends?
Why can't we stay with those cold people we just met

This world is growing cold
My body is breaking down
Why can't we stay with those cold people we just met

Someone die today
Not someone watch what you say
It's not enough for you
You must continue
To raise a family of your own
For all of eternity

Please don't
Tell me you don't want me
Or any of my
Friends

The contentment that
seems to last forever
So I sold my soul to make a record
I can't justify
Giving away all my secrets

I can't justify

This world is growing cold
My body is breaking down
Why can't we die alone?
In a room full of friends?
Why can't we stay with those cold people we just met

This world is growing cold
My body is breaking down
Why can't we stay with those cold people we just met

"The Rest Will Flow"

I was pretending to be floating strong
But I was sinking
In to still water

Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow

Wouldn't give a shit
I am floating still
But still drowning
In my own feelings
All rage, confusion, and doubt

Rest will flow as soon as I
Free myself
So rest will flow as soon as
I get out of here

I always find that I
Lost my way,
And now all I know is that I'm not where I
Has anything ever been

Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow

Wouldn't give a shit
I am floating still
But still drowning
In my own feelings
All rage, confusion, and doubt

Rest will flow as soon as you
Free yourself
So rest will flow as soon as you get out of here

Free yourself
So rest will flow as soon as you get out of here
Free yourself
So rest will flow as soon as you get out of here

"Disappear"

What's left after?
Flies, body horror
Skin covering a secret scar
Blood pouring out of the hole
No trace left
Where do I find the ghost of a loss

I leave my scars (and)
Left behind me
In the distance I pass the wreckage
It takes me back
To a place no one knows
And I look back upon this
As a dream come true

I can't stand the thought of losing someone
I know I'll never be the same

You can see the wound I'm leaving behind
It's deep down inside me
Feel the pain I'm living away from the start

Now what am I to say when the memory runs clear?
I don't wanna be alone
When the world turns to me now
Is it really goodbye?

I wished that I could see you
But I can't remember what I meant
You're a burden for me to see
And I wish it wouldn't end there
I wish there were so many more years
I wish you could see me grow up
And I'll cherish every moment of our friendship
I wish you could see
