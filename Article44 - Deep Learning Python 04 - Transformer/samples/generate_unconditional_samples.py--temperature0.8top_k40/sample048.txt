======================================== SAMPLE 48 ========================================
I'm looking for a new home
It's beautiful there
Everything about this place
Is new and strange

Desert in my eye
Shadows glide across my fingertips
The writing's on the wall
"everything about this place is new and strange"

"The Incident"

At junction 8 the traffic starts to slow
Artilleries of braking lights and bluish glow
Ascending in a plumage of twisted steel
Shattered glass and confetti dashed upon the wheel

When a car crash gets you off you've lost your grip
When a fuck is not enough you know you've slipped
When the church is full it means you've just been had
When the world has gone to seed you're so detached

Got a feeling that I want you to be there

Driving by on my way to somewhere else
I fill my lungs with a noxious burning smell
There is weed and grey concrete like this for miles
Dead souls in my rear view mirror hitch a ride for a while

I want to be loved

"Your Unpleasant Family"

Your unpleasant family,
smashed up my car
(perfectly uncalled for)

Your unpleasant family,
how vile they are
(I crawled out of the wreckage on my knees)

It's alright my flower
so what did we learn?
(there I found regret amongst the trees)

Snaps of a life,
We had in the garden,
We tear up the flowers

"Time Flies"

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced?

Into a suburb of heaven
Yeah, it should've been forever
It all seems to make so much sense

But after a while
You realize time flies
and the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
'Cause time flies

I was raised in a world of report cards and pink slips
There's nothing wrong with that
I don't think I've ever been wrong

But after a while
You realize time flies
and the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
'Cause time flies

And experience is worth it
I'm willing to share my secrets with you

How does time break down
With no marker, things slow down.
A conference of the strange
And your family is deranged

I could tell you what I'm thinking
While we sit here drinking
But I'm not sure where to start

You see there's something wrong here
I'm sorry if I'm not clear,
Can you stop smoking your cigar?

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
'Cause time flies

And experience is worth it
I'm willing to share my secrets with you

How does time break down
With no marker, things slow down.
A conference of the strange
And your family is deranged

It's alright my friend
I don't seem to remember
Can you stop smoking your cigar?

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
'Cause time flies

"Octane Twisted"

We go following sorrow to feel your
Blood spilling out of the reeds there
Give me a sign I can breathe air
Blood flowing out of the stream there

(give me something new please, something I can love)

<|endoftext|>

"The Seance"

Under gas light the joining of hands
Chanting a name over and over

A table tilts the circle is broken
Doubting no more
They pay what they owe her

Disembodied a luminous hand reaching for light
Plunging into any distance to watch the show

Stars burn in the candle
Stars die in the mirror
Stars decay in the crescent moon
Stars give way to colds and brights
and may lose their grip on TV for good

Stars burn in the candle
Stars die in the mirror
Stars give way to dark and bright
and may lose their grip on TV

"The Trouble With Evan"

[I. IN. 1988 â€“ 2015]

Between the flashbacks to back then's events
And the constant stream of events
That somehow we forget
The situations leading to them

Between the vivid and the obscure
Continuing to grow and expand
While keeping the darkness from growing out of control

Overwhelming the Younger
