======================================== SAMPLE 15 ========================================
It's hard to fly a kite
When the morning comes
And the evening stars
Predictable, doesn't it?

"Stars Die"

Are the moons warmer?
Thinning the sky
Orchestral moon
Distant glow from the star
Chemical harvest, bright lights send
Orbits into frozen space

Radiant depression under your eye
Explicitly a sign of death

Penis grows weaker
Better to suffer the loss
Of all that I've believed

Stars die.
Stars die.

Into the cool autumn breeze
Weave our delicate voices through the prismatic haze
And enjoy the slow, steady demise
Of this morbid fascination.

Catching the flakes weaves our thoughts through the still breeze
And we're left with a bewildered and bewildered minds
Head sunken and let down.

Ashes in the water
Sole provider of birth control
Woman best friend left in the wreckage
Of her, of course
And everyone would just say
That's crazy!

They're just like us all
Always finding it hard to hang
And snuffing out the good years

And they raised a boy who's listened to enough talk and could not find a thing

Can you hear me?
There's blood on the table
All the words are dead

There's no choice but to renounce cel
Blood is water
All the words are dead

"Cervantes"

Some will cry
Others will laugh

Some will wave
Some will swear
Some will fly
Some will never know
Some will never understand

Some will never understand

Should we push the boundaries?
Should we condemn this behavior?
Should we condemn this behavior?

Some will fight
Some will cry
Some will win
Some will blame
Some will slip

Blood is water
All the words are dead
Others will laugh

Some will win
Some will lose

Blood is water
All the words are dead
Others will laugh

Some will win
Some will lose

"The Patient"

A heart attack is a death threat
But ausculting a provenance
It is a matter of life and death
For there is a God
And a tyrant

Redemption
For there is a God
And a tyrant

Responsible thinkers
Throw caution to the wind
But no one is certain
Until they are bound

Silent witness to absolution
Enhanced pain
Waves of water coiled in a mist
Coping with disasters

Emeralds of life
Dedicated clinicians
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Wide awake
Wide awake

"Continuum"

Empty house
There's an echo in the hall
I keep your picture in a locket
In the past, we had it all
But the Summer fades away
Rainy day tomorrow

In this courtyard
Outside the courtyard
Outside the courtyard
Outside the courtyard

<|endoftext|>

"I Feel The Dark"

So imagine my surprise at what you found
In your heart buried in a pile of rubble
I feel the dark when I see you

Descending...
From this place
If I die tomorrow
Then all that you know is false

What you deserve
Is who you are

What you deserve
Is what you believe

Descending...
From this place
If I die tomorrow
Then all that you know is false

What you deserve
Is who you are

What you deserve
Is who you are

"Blackest Eyes"

I feel the waves roll in the darkness
But never the wind
As I look through those closed eyes

That soul sealed inside
Will never look away

Redemption
As the night goes on
Don't be afraid to shine
As I look through those closed eyes

And as I look through those closed eyes

I am not alone
I have seen the past and I know it's here
I am the one
That someone alone can save me
Now I know who to call

[V. The Reckoning ]

[Instrumental]

[VI. Salvation]

I survive
I believe
That I can live up to your dreams
And still be a human
By living life as I see it
will give me strength to carry on
This flame that is flame, can't be turned away
This light that is light, can't be turned away
This light that is light, can't be turned away
