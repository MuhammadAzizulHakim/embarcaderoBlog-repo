======================================== SAMPLE 65 ========================================
For even though the day has come
You can still feel the weight in your soul

A part of me is dead

There's another pain in the sand
Still I burn with a thirst
Young and old, searching for a sound
For courage and adventure

"Lightbulb Sun"

The sun is a light bulb
A candle's a treat
The curtains stay closed now
On my little retreat
And as I whistle the whistle of freedom

I'm reaching for the day
And I'm reaching for the day
And I'm reaching for the day
And I'm reaching for the day
And I'm reaching for the day
And I'm reaching for the day
And I'm reaching for the day

"Up The Downstair"

Sleep
Until the colours dissolve
Leave the dream to rain-soak forever
In blessed moments
Viewed from trains of half-truths

Monuments burn into moments
Up into other worlds
Other ascensions
Without deep sorrow to endure

Black Sunday of sleep
Open for small angel escapes
Moved by buildings to tears
They week in the rain
Am I at home?
Am I in heaven?
Gentle Architecture

"Small Fish"

My brother says he wants to die
His cousin adds something to the wine
The truth hurts
My blood is boiling
I'm calling on all my brothers
To give their all
To save humanity

Sunrise into the moonlight
A broken dedication
Vanishing further

Pacing roads unknown
Only pray cast their shadows

Searching for a better life
I've awakened from a dreaming
I've arrived
On this place where I've always been

Brother in law, I'm here
Please come and pray for me
I'll never rest
I'm asking for your forgiveness

GOD DAMN WHEN HE STOPS
 WHEN HE STOPS

"WHAT THE HELL KINNAM!"

I can't remember the first time
He used to hurl himself at me
In a hopeless situation like this
He would never know
The venom in his heart was so strong
I've been hiding within a sickness
Like a sleeper within a dream

I'm on a road I've overrun
It's getting colder by the minute
I'm stopping at noontime to find a trail of drowned water
And I had better get out
As I've nowhere to start

God damn when God damn will he go

When will he stop staring
At the sun and the moon
And just let it go
And walk away?
No reason given

I've been meaning to this shit all along
It's finally dawning on me
It's time for an in between
No nonit, and a leveled goober
Will you be the same
I'll be waiting for you

" Enemy Of The People "

Prince of lies, disguised as a man
Surrounded and amused
By the people who never heard his once brilliant rhyme

A crowd pleads for his blood
To save his people
From famine and war
Soil to misery and misery

He talks about his love
And about the way he dresses
And about the way he sleeps
And about the way he dies

Now I'm dying of hope
Of hope that will tide me over

Heaven's sake, emperor of lies
And pride, giant of a person
I'm dying of happiness that will tide me over

" Jesus ?

[reversed lyrics 2:03-2:22:]
"He Can't Take That Anymore

He can't fight anymore
He's too smart and too ugly
And he's too hard to hate

What did we learn?
Look Jesus has our back
Don't be afraid to walk and talk

We've got to know what's next
What's the message?
We need to know what's next

What took precedence?
What did we learn?
What's the message?

We need to know what's next
What's the message?

What took precedence?
What did we learn?
What's the message?

We need to know what's next
What's the message?

" Jesus Bane "

[IX Restitution]

God save me and my sins
God save me and my sins
God give me what I need
I'm sorry if I'm not thorough
Father I'm not sending you away

Just let me breathe...
Relieve myself...
Open
