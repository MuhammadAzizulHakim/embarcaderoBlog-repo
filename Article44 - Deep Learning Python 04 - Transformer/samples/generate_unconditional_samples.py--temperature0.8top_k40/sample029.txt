======================================== SAMPLE 29 ========================================
Abandoned by my sisters, aiful eyes
I linger on their gravesite
No longer can I help them to save me
From myself

They cry for their savior
Yet I am bent, trying to rise
Though I can't break through their walls

I choose to live and to travel,
Through the haze of loss
Yet I find I can't break through their twisted eyes

Nocturnally sad
As my brothers and fathers
Beneath a screen, see me through this facade

Through a haze of death
I am swallowed by this illusion
Yet I am found not the same

Lost in this spectacle
Is my envy and my pride
Hoping that this test will persuade him
That I can be the man who I am meant to be

And yet I am caught in the loop
I tell this story to prove
That I can be the man who I am meant to be

And yet I am caught in the loop
I tell this story to prove
That I can be the man who I am meant to be

"False Emperor"

The moon shook and curled up like gentle fire
The emperor in my hands

Each day brought more troubles
Abandoned by a dream that brought peace and sanity
These endless days are all that's left

Still the night grew colder
And the rain more savoury
As Iathed in my vows

The moon shook and curled up like gentle fire
The emperor in my hands

Each day brought more troubles
Abandoned by a dream that brought peace and sanity
These endless days are all that's left

Still the night grew colder
And the rain more savoury
As Iathed in my vows

The moon shook and curled up like gentle fire
The emperor in my hands

Your day is numbered
And on every other day
You will find your strength
Daily life is scarred by your passing through

You are a burden to me

"The Killing Hand"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Faythe:]

If I still had something left
I'd surely use my gift
To give her one more breath
To see her smile again
And yet my gift is gone
Along with all her dreams
It vanished with a scream
My fragile voice has all but disappeared

I'll never be free
No one I love
Will ever feel like I lost you
And I can't imagine why

If I ever fell
I'd surely comfort her and she'd begrudge me
The sight of her laughing at all this
would set her ablaze
Her pale face now she's gone
away from me

And I'm leaving
With a wish that sets her ablaze
And I'm leaving
With a wish that she'll stay

And I'm leaving
With a wish that she'll stay
And I'm leaving
With a wish that she'll stay

And I'm leaving
With a wish that she'll stay
And I'm leaving
With a wish that she'll stay

And I'm leaving
With a wish that she'll stay
And I'm leaving

I'm leaving
With a wish that she'll stay
And I'm leaving

"The Enemy Inside"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Night]

[Daryus:]

If I still had something left
I'd surely use my gift
To give her one more breath
To see her smile again
And yet my gift is gone
Along with all her dreams
It vanished with a scream
My fragile voice has all but disappeared

I'll always feel abandoned
When I look for someone to take my place
There's a reason I search for inside

I could leave my woes behind
And open up a new door
Yet I long for someone who will give me strength to carry on
She said hope is found in love
Wings fly from the scene
Those who awaken from the dead

Even when plans fall to pieces
I can still find the strength to carry on
I can't stop the vision from going away
She said beauty is found in hate
Faces twisted in the light
Yet the words that I say are the same

I met with my mother in the hope that she would comfort me
But in the end
