Up, down, left and right
Where the hell have I been?
I'm down, down, left and right
Where the hell have I been?

I'm down, down, left and right
And collecting rain for the Great Over-heating Debate
And getting smarter with every passing day
And how I'll react to an innocent suggestion
That I don't smile when I hear President Bush curse

"Flicker"

Nothing is sacred
And there's nothing you can do
And then there's nothing wrong with that

I don't feel sad when I see my state of mind come down
I don't feel depressed when I hear about the possibility of my dying wish
I didn't have the peace of mind that I'd found in my song
I feel good when I hear my story told

"The Glass Prison"

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And raised in '67
The year of Pearl Jam

I was a symbol of hope
A voice that grew in strength
And confidence to change my life

I was held up as the savior of a people
Tearing doors off of anger, fear, and awe
Brushing it with hope, while still preserving dignity

I was held up as the man who's responsible
For his kind guidance and his undying love
Yet I learned that man's true colors are blue
And the strength that binds us together
Is reflected in his smile

I was held up as the man who understands
And the man who gets us nowhere
Suffering from pain
Yet he continues to bring us together
This friendship is what we need

I was held up as the man who understands
And the man who brings us back
Fighting for our freedom brings us closer than meets the eye

I was held up as the man who understands
And the man that brings us closer than meets the eye

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make up runs

I was held up as the man who understands
And the man who brings us back
Finding solace in his words
That divides us all
When we dance through the rain
There will be no confusion

I was held up as the man who understands
And the man who brings us back
Finding peace in his words
That divides us all
When we dance through the rain
There will be no confusion

"The Best Of Times"

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced?

I was sent to earth
For the sole purpose of testing the waters
I was brought up around romantic ideals
And The Answer lies within each word I say

Summertime is still a sabbatical from me
I tread the air here under the guise of a watchman
But the true test of our faith will be when
And how much we
Have changed in the last year

I can't see the future
But I knew the past would push
To our benefit

When we dance through the rain
We don't wait for the past to make us feel good
We can't wait until the new year is

OWS Maiden
She's our guide
As they dance through the rain
We keep our eyes and
