======================================== SAMPLE 25 ========================================
Whatever you decide
This debate is not your world
These days I spend my days with my family and painting my home
Rustic portraits in the rain
Sometimes I feel I'm treading water
And the other day I commented on how
I like to relax
While in Europe I tried to find a new career
While in the States I've been hating on sneakers

What does it take to make you say "yes"
When millions depend on you every day

"Summer Song"

Tell me once again
What kind of man
Is this
A man who would make you wait for me

He said I'm not invited,
He said I'm free to leave now
He then turned and walked away
Into the distance
Like a ghost within.

He said I'll stay in my own world
And as for you, I thought you could paint
As much as you want
But if I stay in my world
Then you will see."

In his cold, grey and yellow
This was love at its most tender

It's a matter of moments
I'm in danger
I'm in danger
In the glow of the sunset
When the night reaches my
brands.
In the thick of it
The envy of mankind
Sits at their backs
As swathed in glory

I’ve taken life as a sign of my faith
I’ve taken life as a sign of my faith
I’ve taken life as a sign of my faith

And you are finding promise in my words
Calm as cookies and cream
You're finding promise in my words

"Love In The Past Tense"

One hundred rooftops stretch
Across a crowded skyline
Spinning tales from the bleeding heart of music

The roses that blooms
Along with the music
Root it in our hearts
To make it true
And help to keep us sane

We don’t seem to be getting through
This can't be right
Or it's not even right

We feel the pain
We don’t know how to deal with this
Something so real
We’ll never know

Swept away through me
Love in the past tense
Our souls bound by this pain
The memories flow only
Through me

"Sleeping With Your Uncle"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Daryus:]

How can I sleep with my Uncle?
I always seem to forget you
And all I see is
The backyard laughing together
I’ve always wanted to say goodbye
And you are the reason why

For the first time in a long time
We have a son
And he's just the kind of kid
Who’s happy to see his father

[Arhys:]

You think we can't fly
(’ᴙˈxin’)

Or something
(’ᴙˈxin’)

I'm sleeping with my Uncle's brain
(Dying)

[Arhys:]

No more hating me
(ᴙˈxin’)

I'm sleeping with my Uncle's brain
(The saddest dream I ever had)

[Daryus:]

How can I sleep with my Uncle?
I’ve always seemed to forget you
And all I see is
The backyard laughing together
I am sleeping with my soul now

[Arhys:]

How can I sleep with my Uncle?
I’ve always seemed to lose you?
And all I see is
The backyard laughing together
I am sleeping with my soul now

[Daryus:]

How can I sleep with my Uncle?
I’ve always seemed to keep you?
And all I see is
The backyard laughing together

"Moment Of Betrayal"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]
Brace yourself my brother
I’ve taken all of your things
And interrogated your father
All the while you still can't seem to bring yourself to lie down

Now that you're come clean you're forgiven
And there's a better life you lead
You'll never regret anything you do

I will deal with this pain
No matter how long
It's worth it I think I can bring you down

I’ve forgiven you for what you did
And I wish you well
I just can't believe I put up with this
