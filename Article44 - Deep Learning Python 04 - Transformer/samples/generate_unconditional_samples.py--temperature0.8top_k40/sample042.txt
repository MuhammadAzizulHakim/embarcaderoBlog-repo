======================================== SAMPLE 42 ========================================
un-do your math
what do you say if I stand still?
what would you say
if I walked away
would you appreciate the gift you bring

Still the coldest morning in years
still the day for forever
I stand by and nothing is new
I'm counting down the hours
and the deep in between

I don't understand why you can't change the subject

You keep talking about how beautiful things are
and how you despise death
and yet you still keep your mouth shut
and all that you said
was never true
all that you believed

You have everything all along
But you forgot one big word
and the world has changed nothing
because youategorize us
nothing ever happens

Now when I see you walking through the mall
I will keep your lipstick on your wall
and when you're in the parking lot, I will wager my life on her
price
I know I will lose my mind

I'm staring down the hole again
And I don't know what I'll do
nowhere is holding me back

You say you want everyone happy
nowhere is holding me back

You say you want everyone happy
nowhere is holding you back

And you say you want everyone happy
nowhere is holding you back

"Slave Called Shiver"

I need you more than you can know
And if I hurt myself it's just for show
I found a better way to curb the pain
you put a trigger here inside my brain

Mother I need her
I'm falling apart
Mother I need her
And it's only the start

Mother I need her
I'm falling apart
Mother I need her
And it's only the start

Mother I need her
I'm falling apart
Mother I need her
And it's only the start

Mother I need her
I'm falling apart
Mother I need her
And it's only the start

"Don't Hate Me"

A light snow is falling on London
All sign of the living has gone
The train pulls into the stations
And no-one gets off and no-one gets on

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't hate me

"Steal" From The Ashes Of Autumn
A river of tears is rising here
Someone told me to watch out for ticks
In the past 2 days
I have seen the rose and gone
has washed the bad off me

I can't remember the first time
I've felt the pain
I've never felt so bad
I've forgotten what it was like to lose someone
I cried when the Lancers came
cast off their spell
I remember when the good times never came
This shit never came to an end
It never ends

It's so hard to get along
I've got a degree in fiction from the chance I got here
I've got a flat in a trendy suburbia
I'm finding it hard to hang out
It's so hard to get along

I wanna feel the heat
I wanna feel the heat
I wanna feel the heat
I wanna feel the heat
I wanna feel the heat

"Anna Lee"

Helpless corpse on the ground
Her cries deafening the righteous
Soople can't hear you
She's losing herself to the tedium

Wanting to escape to the next floor
She stops caring what gets in her way
What she wants to see is eternity
She knows the pain she's living
She's losing herself to the absurdity

Don't let the day go by
Don't let the day go by
Don't let the day go by
Don't let the day go by

She is stoned
She is stumbling
She is stumbling
She is stumbling
She is stumbling
She is stumbling

"Black Dahlia"

I feel like giving up
I feel like I'm no more than a man
If I
