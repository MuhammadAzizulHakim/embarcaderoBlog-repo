======================================== SAMPLE 67 ========================================
Break of Winter now
I don't know where to begin
I am sitting here poisoned
And no one can save me.

I can't see, I can't feel
I must keep from sinking further

And no one is certain that I've found the answer
There's a void surrounding me
All of the lives I hold
All unrelated
All fleeting
All useless

I sit here drinking
Binge on coffee
Nothing happens
The clock ticks down
And I can't back down

Sailing on the seven wonders
The seven wonders are
Long believed to be haunted
Yet no one seems to have the answer
There's a danger that I may never get there

Once the most shocking place
Once the pinnacle of our knowledge
Now it's the fabled seven wonders

Running through all my myths
Riding through all my orchestrations

I've searched the skies
Seeking out the stars
Of whatever I wish
I've searched the skies

"Beneath The Surface"

Is there ever really a right time?
You had led me to believe
Someday you'd be there for me
When the stars above aligned
When the sky was clear and bright
When dreams could last for days

Until one day I stopped caring
And began to forget why I longed to be so close
And I disappeared into the darkness
It took me longer to realize
I'd never be the same

I'm sitting in the concrete
It's all because IT apps on my TV
It's all the same to me

When I'm down I hide behind the stairs
I don't show my face
When there's trouble admitting that you're wrong
I'll stare into the void until the damage is too great

I'm sitting in the doorway
Ipping out my glasses
With a cold wind in the air
I hear footsteps overhead
And the scratching of a keyboard

"Behind The Veil"

What would possess you to justify
Such dark and twisted ways?
What kind of monster would come to feast
When the devil shows his face?
What does it take for life to change
And a mind to lose control?
Cruelly left you to suffer the blame
After all the lies you told

I am finding courage in our common fear
It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you
It's calling me to task
It's calling me to strength

I am finding strength in our common fear
It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you
It's calling me to task
It's calling me to hope

I am finding strength in our common fear
It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you
It's calling me to task
It's calling me to hope

"In The Presence Of Enemies, Pt. 1"

[I Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[II Resurrection]

I saw a white light
Shining there before me
And walking to it
I waited for the end
A final vision
Promising salvation
A resurrection
For a fallen man

Do you still wait for your God
And the symbol of your faith?

I can free you from this Hell and misery
You should never be ashamed of who you are

Can I speak to your death
A final revelation
That blows my mind?
I can reveal this power to you within a matter of days

I can reveal this power to you within a matter of days

I can reveal this power to you within a matter of days

"The Forest Of October"

The memories that now rests in this forest
Forever
I will watch from the shadows

You are the embodiment of pure freedom
Ileeve the will of my fellow men
In the name of the great

Take the day off your day
And upon your death do you wager your life
On what will be remembered
Over the coming days

I will never be forgotten
Again.

Tattered dreams that are left behind
Fragile ricochet through my head
Each time I close my eyes
There's another echo of me

I will never be forgotten
Again.

Tattered dreams that are left behind
Fragile ricochet through my head
Each time I close my eyes
There's another echo of me

I saw a white light
Shining there before me
And walking to it
I waited for the end
A blinding light
