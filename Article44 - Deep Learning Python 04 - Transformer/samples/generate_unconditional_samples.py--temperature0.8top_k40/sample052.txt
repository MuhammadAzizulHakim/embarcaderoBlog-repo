I don't know how
I'm sick of all
Of this
It's all falling into an abyss
So make your escape
Rise above the terrible

"The Devil's Orchard"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]

Betray my blood
To save my son
In the cold light
Of days gone by

Brother, I will always be
A leader and a survivor
Of what will soon be
A place where I will forever be

Come to terms with this
What I will soon forget
And what will always remain

Is it not wrong to be a warrior
And a burden to follow my own conscience
When all my dreams are shattered
And when love is the answer

"Sleeping With Your Soul In"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Faythe:]

Arhys time is running out
What will your surrender mean?
and what does it matter now?

I'm afraid to be a part of it
Giving up on my people
And reconciling
A part of mania
A part of our creed
A gift you're receiving

Give up on your people
And bring down the world
From within the wake of sorrow

Give up on your people
And bring down the world
From within the wake of sorrow

"Mother"

It's just a part of the daily life
I keep her dreams in check
We barely remember her when we lost her.

She was so young
And loving and innocent
I can remember when she cried

She was hiding a wish in her heart
That she could push herself out and live her own life
But she was never really sure

She was hiding a disease in her heart
That left her lonely and lonely
She couldn't take the weight
On her wishes
And her true feelings never found their way
She tried her best to hide them
But she couldn't hold on any longer

"Brother, Can You Hear Me?"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Night]

[Daryus:]

Father can you hear me?
I'm afraid to be the last one to gaze
At the passing of the moon
This moment I can be all that I am
Even when it's raining
There's nothing left to hide

And as for the grace I possess
I am no longer a slave to my past
I am beginning to humbled and enhanced

Through the gift of blood
I am humbled and enhanced
I am a god among heroes
I am humbled and enhanced

As I read this message I am humbled and enhanced
I am humbled and enhanced

[Daryus:]

Heh heh heh heh
It's not too late for me
Just come down...
Drop the bags and get away
You redneck
Not too proud to be black

Exhile, expel
Spare me

Exhale, expel
Spare me

Exhale, expel
Spare me

Exhale, expel
Spare me

Exhale, expel
Spare me
