======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
The price we pay for freedom is eternal damnation
Our venom's in your throat

Swept away with the tide
Through the holes in your hands
Drown with the tide
In eternity's end

Where the disparate voices of dissent
Build a voice for change
And a safer world
Where everyone is bound to the same truth

You're blinded by your venom
While within the venom you feed
The echo of hatred
Blaming dissent in massive waves

Swept away with the tide
Through the holes in your hands
Drown with the tide
In eternity's end

Where the disparate voices of dissent
Build a voice for change
And a safer world
Where everyone is bound to the same truth

Blurring the lines
Between virtue and sin
You can't shame a soul into silence
Until you're no longer willing to admit it

Swept away with the tide
Through the holes in your hands
Drown with the tide
In eternity's end

Where the disparate voices of dissent
Build a voice for change
And a safer world
Where everyone is bound to the same truth

"Fear Inoculum"

Immunity, long overdue
Contagion, I exhale you
Naive, I opened up to you
Venom and mania
Now, contagion, I exhale you

The deceiver says, he says
You belong to me
You don't wanna breathe the light of the others
Fear the light, fear the breath
Fear the others for eternity
But immunity, immunity
It filters through the toxins
And soon you're a telegram from heaven

Don't want to be ignored
Don't want to be caricatured
Don't wanna be ignored
No one's perfect, just please don't

"Neglecting Your Father"

We sat through the Sixers season
On and off the court
It's a miracle we still exist

Still, I don't think I've ever said I'm sick
And I'm not the only one

So hard to control
Like a cancer that you can never cure

Can't stop the world from turning around
Or at least try to think about it
Until you're sick with it

The current state of things
It's not too bad
It's not too bad
I'm perfectly fine
Though I'm crying

I don't want to die

The way that you look when you're young
The way that I feel when I'm in my late twenties
The way that you talk to me when I'm sleeping man
It's all the same

Can't stop the world from turning around
Or at least try to think about it
Until you're sick with it

The current state of things
It's not too bad
It's not too bad
I'm perfectly fine
Though I'm crying

I don't want to die

The way that you look when you're young
The way that I feel when I'm sleeping man
It's all the same

Can't stop the world from turning around
Or at least try to think about it
Until you're sick with it

The current state of things
It's not too bad
It's not too bad
I'm perfectly fine
Though I'm crying

"The OAuNy"

Some say the end is here
Yes, we know the world is heading in the wrong direction
Hurricanes are speeding through the woods
Stronger and stronger the waves
And the broadcast of war
Paying all your dues to silence the cries

Isn't it time we made a change?
We've got to save the future
Before we abandon our ways
Before we give up the past

While we're at it
Another reason to hope
Believe in the underdog
Fight for your future
And what you have dreamed of
Is still a possibility

You're getting older
But you're not standing still
You're closer to the end
You realize you're reaching
And fighting until you're no longer welcome

Maybe when the spirits of the bereaved
Come alive
its easier to forget

You're getting weaker and weaker
And fighting to stay alive
Fight the fear that haunts you

Your body is shaking
It's almost like your spirit has died

"I walk beside you
There is nothing new here
I lay here alone
I lie here alone
I do not recall seeing you before
Or acting this way

I walk beside you
There is no more pain and no less destruction
I laugh and I cry

You're getting older
And fighting to stay alive
Fight the fear that haunts you
