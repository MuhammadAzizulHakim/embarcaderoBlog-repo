======================================== SAMPLE 89 ========================================
When you pass through the gateways alone
You will come for love and peace
And comfort and alone
When you pass through the gates alone
You will passionsately cry
And may the two of you meet
When the day of your unconditional love dies

Hidden in their smiles
Two innocent faces with twisted eyes
Perversions of faith
Mercy for the innocent

When you pass through the gates alone
You will come for love and peace
And comfort and alone
When you pass through the gates alone
You will passionsately cry
And may the two of you meet
When the day of your unconditional love dies

"Without You"

Without you
No more resentments
Growing stronger
Breathing life into the cold

Without you
No more blame
No lessered

Nothing you forgot
You're still loved
Just a piece of meat
Taste of vanilla, vanilla bean

Without you
No more respected
Bloodshed over how you look
Glorious dance of death

Without you
No more sad
Glorious death

Bloodshed over how you look
Glorious death

"Black Dahlia"

You have no interest in the past
Where you came from
Where you're going to

There's a cliche in your eye
File the edges down
Soon be underground

There's nothing here for you under the sun
There's nothing new to do, it's all been done
So put your faith in another place

Never seem to get away from this
It's all falling into an abyss
So put your foot on the pedal boy

All you know is secondhand
The bullet passed through the cage inside you

You stole the only thing you love
So unfaithful, the drop is fatal

"Remember Me Lover"

I didn't want to feel like a slave to your mood swings
And I'm not saying anything I wouldn't say behind your back
And all this shit could have happened to anyone
All that matters now is how you gonna pick it up to throw it back

It's so hard to get along
I always know what you're gonna say
This too: I hate you
Like I hated you

I wish you'd stop storming
I wish you could go back to being
I wish you could go and see me play
I wish you could go and find me a better way

It's so hard to get along
I always know what you're gonna say
This too: I hate you
Like I hated you

I wish you'd stop storming
I wish you could go back to being
I wish you could go and see me play
I wish you could go and find me a better way

It's so hard to get along

I wish you could go and find me a better way

" Enemy Of The People "

When President Bush was still a virgin boy would run to tell him about the new car
They had made him a promise to "never ask me why"
but never really fulfilled
now he's got a son who will be five when he turns 5

And I'm all for free speech
And I'm all for fairness
But I'm all for research
And I'm all for freedom of religion
But I'm all for openness
But I'm all for love

When I hear the old way
Of getting by in print without giving up
How tolerable it must be to be
For instance, I know what I am meant to be
But I must live up to that

" Bohemian Rhapsody "

Bellow up, buddy
Barely a beat, bleeding pain
Love in the past, buddy
Just a piece of meat, buddy
Too much pride, buddy
You're just a cog in a machine
Bought, buddy
Just keep the brick, buddy
Strong as a fist, buddy

Come down, buddy
Only buddy safe
Boredom's not a thing
It only pollutes the air
So fuck you for what you're worth

Bellow up, buddy
Barely a beat, bleeding pain
Love in the past, buddy
Just a piece of meat, buddy
Too much pride, buddy
You're just a cog in a machine
Bought, buddy
Just keep the brick, buddy
Strong as a fist,
