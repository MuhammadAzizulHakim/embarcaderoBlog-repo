"Footprints"

I saw her footprints on the sea
I knew her eyes were watching me
So I ventured further in my mind
In the hope that I would find:

"Tangerine Trees and Marmalade Skies and
Plasticine Porters with Looking Glass Ties"

My mind had formed a mental prison
I cried aloud no-one would listen
Then floating through the heavy mist
My vision took a sudden twist

Empty people stood in grey
Children laughing far away
An empty courtyard wept alone
Rain lashed down on darkened stone

A crystal glove points to the door
A threshold I had crossed before
On getting to know the girl
I had to understand why she was searching for me.

Without warning the girl in the mirror gasped
Her name was on the door.
Her heart was racing, trying to find the words
She had just said to erase all her pain.
Without warning the girl in the mirror gasped
Her name was on the door.

Without warning the girl in the mirror gasped
Her name was on the door.

I waited painfully
For the moment to emerge
Yet again I sat motionless
As the mirror rattled
With a cry I knew is futile
She could not in good conscience answer
The door has recently been closed

Without warning the door has recently been closed
It is now and then
I wiped the dust on my hands
and began to walk
Through the dark

I was with my mother and father
Just as the sirens blew
As I reached for the glass
I saw the red lights illuminate
The empty streets of my own tiny northern shack
I walked along darkened streets
all alone
In the dark without a care

I am the girl in the mirror
I am the one who noticed
And now I know why she was searching for me

Without warning the door has recently been closed
It is now and then
I wiped the dust on my hands
and began to walk
Through the dark

"Black Dahlia"

You have no interest in the past
Where you came from
Where you're going to

You can't keep your mouth shut
Red herrings and diabolical plans
They will only make you sick
Again

The only thing
That I care about most
Is our future

Nothing is what I've learned
So if the past is anything but true
Then the present time is certainly not the time

And the hope is never too far away

Don't look for the answers
Clear your mind
Lust between now and then

"The Bigger Picture"

Long before the colors start to bleed
I can see
The whole thing is blown out of proportion
The whole thing is so bigoted
So many words said and done
It's almost like hate speech
It's almost like I'm something
But I'm not hate, I'm just a person

I gotta work it out in the shade
I gotta roll with the times
When the light comes on
I gotta find the meaning behind this
I feel like I'm walking out of time

Through the haze of a dream
I can't stop the world from turning blue
Sole provider of death
Still brooding and brooding
Kiss me when I feel like I'm sinking

Sole provider of death
Still brooding and brooding
Kiss me when I feel like I'm sinking

"Jambi"

Here from the king's mountain high
Here from a wild dream come true
Feast like a sultan I do
On treasures and flesh, never few

But I, I would wish it all away
If I thought I'd lose you just one day

The devil and his had me down
In love with the dark side tonight
Dancing with fireflies on the sky
Nothing beats the feeling
Of longing for the dark side

So hard to get along
With all my heart in one place
And it's all just biding time
You're gonna be alright buddy

It's such a pain to feel you die alone
With all my soul in one place
And no one to blame

Cinderella boy everything is gonna be alright
Cause they'll be alright until daddy dies

You don't wanna be down at the funeral
You don't wanna be down in the audience
That means nothing to them all

Cinderella boy everything is gonna be alright
Cause they'll be alright until daddy dies
