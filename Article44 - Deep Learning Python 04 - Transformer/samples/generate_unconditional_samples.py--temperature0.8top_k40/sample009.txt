You drop the ball and let the game die
Permeate.
My prayer is met.
I'm forgiven.
I'm envious of what you've done.
I'm envious of what you've done.
I'm envious of what you've done.

Now that your balls have settled in, it's time to throw your weight around.
Throw it around.
Hance your run.
Shuffling through the air.

Throw it around.
Hance your run.
Shuffling through the air.

I'm envious
I'm envious
I'm envious
I'm envious

Now that your balls have settled in
It's time to throw your weight around.
Throw it around.
Hance your run.
Shuffling through the air.

Move it (moved it)
Move it!
Move it (moved it)
Move it (moved it)

I'm envious
I'm envious
I'm envious

" Enemy Of Enemies"

The Enemy within is the leader
He is the one
With a gun and a poison
He is the one
Who will soon be standing his ground

He lives within the threat
He is the one who will soon be standing his ground

He lives within the threat
He is the one who will soon be standing his ground

He lives within the threat
He is the one who will soon be standing his ground

He lives within the threat
He is the one who will soon be standing his ground

He lives within the threat
He is the one who will soon be standing his ground

He lives within the threat
He is the one who will soon be standing his ground

" Enemy Of Enemies"

Every day I wake up without day,
With the darkness surrounding me.
Under the coldness of night I sense
The danger surrounding me.
Feeling strangers staring my way,
Every day I face the fear that I harbor.
The unknown is the unknown every day.

I would never expect that
I must live within the unknown every day.
I must wait for the unknown to come and take me away.
I must listen religiously to the seers and
Listen religiously to the magicians
When the prophets will come and will give you your final word.

" Observance "

[These lyrics are played backwards:]
"That which I feel is right,
That which I hold to be wrong,
Should be left to the winds.
That which I enjoy,
That which I hold to be special,
Should be left to the wolves.

I don't always get what I want
Sometimes I'm trapped in a moment's hesitation
I turn to my friends and tell them,
"God, God, why do you do what you do?"

I have always had the answers To The Ones Who Last
And The Responsible Responsible
Knowledge that I hold dear
And have trust in me to keep
The answers

" Exodus "

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Eran Arhys' Spirit:]
Brother, can you hear me?
His life is in your hands
He is only a child
And the wounds that he's endured
Will only make more sense
Now that he understands
We're moving like a tonne upon stone
He won't know how his final judgement will live on in his head

"That which I feel is right,
That which I hold to be right
Should be left to the wolves
