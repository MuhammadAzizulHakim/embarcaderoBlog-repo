======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================
I don't know why
I've been waiting all this time

Have I seen the way your smile
Leaves scars on the ground
Where scars on the ground
Tell me why

Swept away with the morning rays
Through the blackness left behind
In the drifting air
I feel the chill in my eye
And the tears start falling

I'm waiting for something new
Standing in the light
Of their splendour

I'm finding out what all of this means

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make up runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my dreams are wrong
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are wrong
That's where my love lies
It's where my heart is empty of regrets
It's where my soul is burning
It's where my heart is the fuel that keeps me sane

A walk in the woods and I will try something new
It's so erotic when your make up runs
Find someplace where your heart is pure and white
And why don't you go to sleep with your hands on your grave
It's a waste of your time

A walk in the woods and I will try something new
It's so erotic when your face is painted black
And why don't you go to sleep with your hands on your grave
It's a waste of your time

"Trains"

Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hiss of the train at the railway head

Always the summers are slipping away

A 60 ton angel falls to the earth
A pile of old metal, a radiant blur
Scars in the country, the summer and her

Always the summers are slipping away
Find me a way for making it stay

When I hear the engine pass
I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides
I'm in luck

When the evening reaches here
You're tying me up
I'm dying of love
It's OK

"Lips Of Ashes"

Paralysed
Lips of Ashes
Synchronised
Blue vein crashes

Touching you inside

Idolised
Black Eyes fading
You and I
Connection failing

I drill down inside

"The Sound Of Muzak"

Hear the sound of music
Drifting in the aisles
Elevator Prozac
Stretching on for miles

The music of the future
Will not entertain
It's only meant to repress
And neutralize your brain

Soul gets squeezed out
Edges get blunt
Demographic
Gives what you want

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world that no one cares
No one cares enough

Now the sound of music
Comes in silver pills
Engineered to suit you
Building cheaper thrills

The music of rebellion
Makes you wanna rage
But it's made by millionaires
Who are nearly twice your age

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world that no one cares
No one cares enough

"Gravity Eyelids"

Open your eyes now
Hear me out before I lose my mind
I've been waiting for hours
Let the salt flow, feel my coil unwind

Give me a smile please
Count the calm and watch my breathing slow
Winding me up tease
Get inside my head and make it show

Gravity eyelids come down

Touching your oil skin
Slipping hands down past your waist to find
I've been waiting for hours
Let the salt flow, feel my coil unwind
Go to the edge swim
Brown the eyes that sleep has rendered blind

Gravity eyelids come down
Come love at a price
A glass eye knife will do
Nothing if you screw it up

"Prodigal"

I don't know whose side I'm on
I don't think
