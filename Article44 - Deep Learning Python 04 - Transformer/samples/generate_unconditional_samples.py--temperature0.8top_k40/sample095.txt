======================================== SAMPLE 95 ========================================

I am sick of all your ways
And wondering why
Why I never learn
How to smile
Face to face with you
Skin to skin, soul to soul

I want to stay alive
The flame that burns in my chest
Will never rest
I want to conquer the mind
Before the body is burnt to ashes

Caught in the Web
Removed from the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning the lies
devised in my head
Caught in the Web
Removed from the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning a cage
Lying at the mercy of our own foolishness

"Boredom's Not A Crime"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And cries
"I can't breathe, I can't feel
A thousand summers in the making
You've got to understand
The world is changing all at once
You can't keep a secret
That some person you love
And could use some help here
You know you're gonna get away with murder
"but it's too late for you"

I was called a hero
A mother cried a lullaby to a boy
Somewhere like heat
On his way to wealth
But wealth is a test he needs the most

Yet the noise from the traffic on the shoulder
Should've left a stain on the glass
Maybe it's time to turn to crime

A few hours drive you to tears
It's a long way to get to a place
Where people will turn to see you

But no-one will know what you tried
and all that they see
You fell down a hole
So afraid to look in

You thought you could control the way you walk
Now you can't without the balls
And the taunts
You have to spit at
You're hated here
For all the shit you threw
But no-one will know what you wrote

You said you wanted everyone happy
Now everyone's happy

Now every morning IThrow a fit
While the ratsat will cry
I'm the rotted one
I'm the one who died

"Girls Matter"

Lost in the darkness of time
Is when she woke me up
And when she did,
The memories that had been fading slowly inside
I could not break through
She turned to me with her royal smile
and said,
"I wish you'd stay
That much longer
She can see I'm you."

The chasm that opened up in me
As I reached out and touched her
The thought that had been haunting me for years
had finally comforted me
I knew the end was come
It had been all that I needed
It had been all that I could take

Now I know why I yearn for you
It's all about the fight
It's all about the fight
It's all about the fight

It keeps me sane
It keeps me sane
It keeps me sane
It keeps me sane

It keeps me sane
It keeps me sane
It keeps me sane

"Message To Harryhausen"

"I wish he would stop what he is doing.
He is a man of tremendous talent, and I know from his words that
He is not to be trusted. He should know better.
I wrote him down and sent for Elder Wand, but
I do not have the strength to hold him down.
I am afraid to show what I have done,
I am afraid to show what I have done
To anyone, and I know where I stand.

I have kept his pride high, I have gone to great lengths
To make sure he understands,
But I must go down as the man who cursed me with this thought.
No matter how hard I try,
He will never be the same.

I know that I am meant for anything that I do,
even when that means losing you.
I know that I am loved and I know that I am loved,
even when that means losing you.
I know that I am taught and I know that I am taught
Even when that means losing you, that is when things get personal
For I know that I am loved and I know that I am loved
Even when that means losing you.

It's not too late for me,
My wounds are still healing
I know that my time here will change all for me
It's not too late for me,
My wounds are still healing
I know that my time here will change all for me

"Rest In Peace"

I am alive and I know
