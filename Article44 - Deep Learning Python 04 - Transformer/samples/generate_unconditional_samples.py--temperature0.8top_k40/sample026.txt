The Twilight's a Blind Faith
And the Hearth's a Blind Faith

These are our tears
They are our blood
They are our blood...
But we're not buying it
It's not right
We feel the pain
We feel the anger
We feel the pain
We feel the anger
We feel the pain

Angels fall
all for you
all you've done
in a blink of an eye
You're the embodiment of evil
all your words are lies
all your smiles are lies
all those who believed
in your lies
all those eyes on your land

Tears of sorrow wash my soul
cold ashes ignite the flame
In this moment I'm your savior
he's my brother's burden
he's the embodiment of your lies

For as fragile as you are, you are most certainly awake
from the slumber of secrets
breath of life
bird of the wind

Threats and lies from the nest
grow stronger
and stronger
and stronger

"The Moor"

The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in muddy waters, poured down my throat
Seen the ghost of fate in my eyes

By the way, I am doing fine, I know
I have nothing against you
but that's just the way I am

I would wait for you, an idol for which I paid the price
hidden in my heart

If I were you I would surely be frightened
for my love, for my life would surely crumble

Swept away, then hiked, then hiked again

Overwhelmed, thenwhelmed
Finally got the truth
and now I can begin
To erase you as well
as possible
I must erase you as well
Until I hear your voice I'll never hear it
and then I'll move on
Because of you I am stronger
than before

"The Night And The Silent Water"

And so you left us
Jaded and gaunt, some September
Wilted with the seasons
But hidden inside the delusion
that night is still forever

You had guessed it
Now we know
For sure you're meek and childlike
No witness would dare to stand
In my presence

At times the dark's fading slowly
But it never sustains
It never falters
It never questions its own sanity
It never questions its fellows' guilt
It never questions its own ressources
It never questions its own self-fulfilling prophecies

Such a tragic sight you are
As we all gather at the gates
In dismay, strangest twist
A sleeping giant
Sighing deep under his breath

Hidden within the night
Are the walls that keep me constantly
And the strange thoughts that feed me
Every vivid thought
I dream of revenge
Every vivid thought
I would destroy
To pave the way for another day

"Still Day Beneath The Sun"

There is a light that hits the gloom around
and the angel of balance that always keeps me alive
spots the light that was shed
on my wall.
hidden by the darkness that is me
the crawling of the wings
that always keeps me constantly
And the strange thoughts that feed me
Every vivid thought
I dream of revenge
Every vivid thought
I would destroy
To pave the way for another day

"Patterns In The Ivy 2"

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced?

I was given a copy
at the age of seven
and have always been
a part of
that moment
when I noticed the pattern
in my eye
I said "what the hell is going on?"
the message was clear
and unafraid,
standing up for what is right
and standing up for what's wrong

I was left behind
like all the others
who grew up in that moment
I am the first one
who reached out for love
and never lost my will

With confidence and grace
I never lost my faith
And now I can see the meaning
in my heart

It's not too late for me to watch
On her back is her pride
A knot that's never broken
screams of agony

I'm left behind
Like all the others
who grew up in that moment
I am the first one
who reached out for love
and never lost my will

With confidence and grace
I never lost my faith
And now I can see the meaning
in my heart

It's not too late for me to watch
On her back is
