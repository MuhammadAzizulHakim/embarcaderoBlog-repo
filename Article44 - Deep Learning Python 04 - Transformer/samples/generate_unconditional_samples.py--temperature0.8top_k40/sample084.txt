======================================== SAMPLE 84 ========================================
We know she was involved in 9/11

So, so strange.
Nothing seems to happen.
Cracks in the pavement,
Twisting, turning.
Losing my sense of time.

Like a scream, stopping, turning again.

No matter.
The cry is his.
He is the man.
He is the man.
He is the one.

So strange.
Nothing seems to happen.
Cracks in the pavement,
Twisting, turning.
Losing my sense of time.

And I feel it starting to take over me
I don't know why.
Something's burning inside me.
Fever mirrored tears began to fall.

Don't know why.
I don't know why.

I can't remember how or why
I feel anything.

I may never get over.
I may never get over.
I may never get over.

I know what it's like.
To lose someone you love.
It's so hard to get over.

Family torn apart
Ganja fed the fire
Coping with this shit again
Wondering when this will end.

Don't know why.
I don't know why.

I can't remember how or why
I feel anything.

I may never get over.
I may never get over.
I may never get over.

I know what it's like
To lose someone you love.
It's so hard to get over.

Funny feeling.
Not all martyrs see the light
Of compassion and love

It's all about you.
Some will never see the light
Of forgiveness and love

And some will never learn to live with
Some can see the damage
And some can learn to die

Don't know why.
I don't know why.

I feel it starting to take over me
I may never get over.
I may never get over.
I may never get over.

I know what it's like.
To lose someone you love.
It's so hard to get over.

"This Is No Rehearsal"

How many children did I bring into this world?
How many did I lose in the shopping arcade?

This is no rehearsal - play it back
and throw things at the screen
This is no rehearsal - somebody
interpret this for me

And still I remember how I dressed him this morning
And then he was gone - stolen, my only one

I'm sorry if I'm not your voice
but I'm certainly not your friend
So if you're not on your TV, why can't you be on your TV too?

And then the rang, and the tune
And then the red, and the white, and the flowers
And then you rang, and the tune
And then the red, and the white, and the flowers
And then you rang the red, and the white
and the flowers, and then the red, and the red, and the red, and the roses
And then the siren, and the guy with the egg
And then the egg is running dry

How does this feel to have lost my hand?

It's no fun to be told
That you weren't invited...

How does this feel to have lost my hand?

It's no fun to be told
That you weren't invited...

How does this feel to have lost my hand?

"Flicker"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light in
Our new craze works
It's doing the talking
Only to confuse the people
When will this end?

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light in
Our new craze will do the talking
Only when the time is right

Barely a flicker of the light in
