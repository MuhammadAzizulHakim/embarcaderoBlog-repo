======================================== SAMPLE 63 ========================================
We have come to despise you
We have taken the blood of those we honor
And twisted their ways to spite

Cold and bitter and ruthless
We have traveled to find you
We have taken the lives of so many

Blood...Heal me
Pain...Heal me
Fear me...

"Heart in Hand"

"It's simply woeful. Yuck!"
"Who the hell are you?"
[Quote from "Skrot-Nisse" by Jan Lööf]

Take it as a threat now and leave
Drop of toxins flows to a habit
Tell me what it is you can't see
Don't you dare point it at me

Warrants of steel
Waiting
Caught in wait

Gravity rays
Twisting
Slam down on the moon
Tearing down the sky

The irony of this world
Where life has gone astray
They are waiting to see if humanity can live again

They are rotting within this nightmare
Saw shadows on the ceiling
Their distrust of reason
Was born of desperation
This irrational fear is breeding

Snaps of a friendship
Melinda and I
Would trade our freedom for another kiss
Laughter from the sidelines
She knew her soul would be boarded

It's just woeful. Yuck!

It's simply woeful. Yuck!

It's simply woeful. Yuck!

Waiting
Catching the flakes of dismay
That churns into anxiety

Catching the flakes of dismay
That churns into anxiety
Waiting
Forever bored
Controlling my life

Wanting to be a saviour
Of sorts
Processing life force
For the praise
The vilest of sins
Attention span all walks

Waiting
Boring
Fading
Delusions
Warped inside

Expecting
Being undone by
Unquenchable thirst
Spiraling to the bone

Typical
We are
Waiting
Boring
Fading
Delusions
Warped inside

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their saviour's calling
Of a emptying stream

Typical
We are
Waiting
Boring
Fading
Delusions
Warped inside

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their salvation
Of a emptying stream

"When Your Time Has Come"

[Bonus track]

Bonus track

All your questions,
All your behavior,
All your thoughts,
All your feelings?

When your time has come
When you're willing to let go
When you're afraid of speaking your mind
You're never going to get out

When you're afraid of speaking your mind
You're never going to get out

You can be fearless,
You can be vain,
You can be sad,
You can be bitter,
You can be selfish,
You can be both

Always with you,
Always with you
Always with you
Always with you

When you're afraid of speaking your mind
You're never going to get out

When you're afraid of speaking your mind
You're never going to get out

You can be fearless,
You can be vain,
You can be sad,
You can be both

Always with you,
Always with you
Always with you
Always with you

When you're afraid of speaking your mind
You're never going to get out

"Fear Of A Blank Planet"

Sunlight coming through the haze
No gaps in the blinds
To let it inside
The bed unread

TV not my cup of tea
But it's my house, so I'll be safe
Sleep here in the rain

Never in a dream do I recall
Looking so far out

TV not my cup of tea
But it's my house, so I'll be safe
Sleep here in the rain

"Risking It All"

Justify the destruction
Of all that I see
Justify the loss
Of all that I thought
Justify the pursuit of happiness
Justify the pursuit of death

We know better
The scars on our scars
Will linger in the wake of our deeds
And so it goes with our lives
When we act out
We mitigate the blow
When we remain passiveaggressive
We give chase
And in the final hour of our lives
When we act out
We minimize the damage
That way they'll recognize our sacrifice

Sacrifice our lives
Self-centered blame just
