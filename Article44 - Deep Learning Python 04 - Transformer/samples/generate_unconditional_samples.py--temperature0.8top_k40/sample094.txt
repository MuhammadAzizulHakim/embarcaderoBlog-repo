Spiraling down
Waiting
Blackest lullaby
Your senses dissolve
And your dreams are dashed
Come true

We lie stilled the rest of the deeds
In the wake of yesterday
The dawning of a nameless night
When all our dreams are gone

"In The Mist She Was Standing"

Seven years, and she's still sleeping
Seven years and she's still sleeping
Seven years
And she can't remember when
She's lost her sight

And when the night becomes the day
And when night becomes the day
And when night becomes the day

It was the only wish
It seemed endless
It brought true to life
A flawless new beginning
An age-old mystery
Saw her fading smile

Thinking about her
Seven years have passed
And she can't remember when
She's lost her sight

And when the night becomes the day
And when night becomes the day
And when night becomes the day

It was the only wish
It seemed endless
It brought true to life
A flawless new beginning
An age-old mystery
Saw her fading smile

"My Last Farewell"

[INT. Ravenskill Rebel Command - Night]

[Arhys:]
As fearless leader of the Ravenskill militia
The blood of warriors
Flows throughout my veins

My brother's gift remains my secret ammunition
It is our faith in need
A symbol of freedom
A soundness we cannotAntagon

Our brother's gift remains my secret ammunition
It is our faith in need
A symbol of freedom
A soundness we cannotAntagon

Our thoughts are legion
They are wary of discussing matters of faith

"A Farewell To Renewal"

[EXT. Ravenskill Rebel Command - Night]

[Daryus:]
We're still a long way from reaching the end
But we will rise, we will fall
Together we're going to Heaven

The end of an era
Of untold lengths
The end of a chapter
Of untold tales
And of one man's final moment

I'll never forget
As the final spark
That blew his life into me

The night turned to day
As he sat by my side

He said:
"The end is near...
You'll see".
I'll never forget
As the final spark
That blew his life into me

The night turned to night
As he sat by my side

He said
"All your lives..."
I asked how
Could this be?
He said, "It's not my life
It's yours alone.
It may come back to bite you."
Then he looked away
As he heard me talk about
The meaning in his life

I've hidden all of my sins
To those who may not know
Through my lies
In my den of thieves
And buried their dead
In my den of deceit

"Harridan's Wreath"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Night]

[Narrator:]
Finds a way
To salvation
For the man who died for her

[Gabriel:]
As a child she cried
For her country
And best friend
She cried
For her
father
She was a burden
He was a burden

And she wanted nothing more
To slip away

Sits here with all my heart
And nothing more to lose

I'll always love her
Because of you I'll always love myself

And she'll never know
If everything's alright
I'll rise again

[fades out on]
Fixed by her grace
Apprehensive and uncooperative
She makes her way through the crowd

[Gabriel:]
Nothing
I'm innocent
When was the last time you saw your soul burning hot?
I don't know if it's haunted me or not
