======================================== SAMPLE 78 ========================================
Take me to my home
Tell me of your splendour, thy beauty
Divine gift, splendour, thy gift
Give me thy word again
Embrace us, remember us
Weave our part, remember us

Swept away, severed
In fragments, souls sewn witlessly to a stone

Bound, loosed
And saved
I'm still alive
If I'm so minded
I know the truth
And I'm the one to know it

We're here
The moment we all wish to forget
The moment the world lost its faith in you
This solitary candlelight vigil
That burns his soul to ashes
Spark, a spark
Flame, a fuse
Together we smoldering wreckage

We're here
The moment we all wish to forget
The moment the world lost its faith in you
This solitary candlelight vigil
That burns his soul to ashes
Spark, a spark
Flame, a fuse
Together we smoldering wreckage

We're here

"Cold And Useless"

A leaf falls from the Summer
And my clothes tumble to the ground

I'm greeted by a cold and empty
Like the days are late
And my clothes are all gone

"Your Unpleasant Family"

Your unpleasant family,
smashed up my car
(I'm sorry, I'm not welcome here)


Your unpleasant family,
how vile they are
(I won't take the easy way out)

It's alright my flower
so what did we learn?
(We descended too late)

Snaps of a life,
We werehes,
On our way to flowers
(Where do we begin to make our roses bloom?)

"Hex Omega"

Two years
In the company of my wife and I
We rode the tear of the storm

Once upon a time,
We made it to the top of the world
(We went down too)

Twirling round the bend
I could see
Up to the sky
Two shining stars
Counting forever
)

My ashes within your embrace
I could weep uncontrollably
I could give you life
You were always my own
So embrace me

And I would take you with me
Once we rose to our senses
We werehes began
And beauty was my guide
And I would give you life
As I gaze down through your skin

Once I knew we were together
We were so innocent eyes
We found a way to live our lives
We barely knew the things that we wanted to see
We werehes began
And beauty was my guide
And I would give you life
You were always my own
So embrace me

I once thought I knew you
Once I knew we were together
We were so innocent eyes
We found a way to live our lives
We barely knew the things that we wanted to see
We were youthful wits, edge of our eyes

But now that I see you, I know we're bound to grow
We're bound to keep you alive
When we both feel the end is near

Without you we are nothing but silent
Without you we are nothing but silent
Without love we are nothing but silent
Without compassion we are nothing but silent
Without love we are nothing but silent
Without compassion we are nothing but silent
Without love we are nothing but silent
Without love we are nothing but silent
Without love we are nothing but silent
Without love we are nothing but silent
Without love we are nothing but silent
Without love we are nothing but silent

"The Glass Prison"

[I. REFLECTION]

Cunning, Baffling, Powerful
Beating for air
Eyes are open
Baffled and powerless
Responsible and brave
Spoke and smiled and ignored
All others let him go
Nothing ever happened

And still she waits for change
Standing by and watched
His every move, every move
Beating for the light
She protected
