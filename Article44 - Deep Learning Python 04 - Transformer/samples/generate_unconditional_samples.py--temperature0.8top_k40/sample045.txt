"Pure Narcotic"

You keep me waiting
You keep me alone in a room full of friends
You keep me hating

No one can save you

And I've lost all I've done
So I head for the hills
And pills in my bowl
To recharge my life

A little voice in my head says
We can't lose this fight
A little voice in our head says
You're doing fine but,
Must try more
Running headlong at me

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

Sacrifice my life
Neglect my kids and wife
All for you to be happy
All those sleepless nights
And countless fights to give you more
And then you say how dare that
I didn't write you back
I must be too good for you
I only care about myself

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

"Sacrificed Sons"

[Begins with samples from 9/11]

Walls are closing
Anxiously
Channel surfing
Frantically

Burning City
Smoke and fire
Planes we're certain
Faith inspired

No clues
A complete surprise
Who'll be
Coming home tonight

Heads all turning
Towards the sky
Towers crumble
Heroes die

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

Teach them what to think and feel
Your ways so enlightening
Words they preach I can't relate
If God's true Love are acts of Hate?

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

God on High
Our mistakes
Will mankind be extinct?

There's no time,
Time to waste
Who serves the truth
For Heavens' sake?

"Octavarium"

[I. Someone Like Him] [0:00 â€’ 8:47]

I never wanted to become someone like him so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that
This was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore to make him out to be some kind of monster

And when I think of my own child
When I'm too weak to stand
And too numb to pain
To feel like I got away

And when I think of my own child
When I'm too weak to speak
And too numb to pain
To feel like I got away

And when I think of my own child
When I'm too weak to act
And too numb to pain
To feel like I got away

And when I think of my own child
When I'm too weak to feel
And too numb to pain
To feel like I got away

II. Salvation
Ashes in my hands
Recast my tale
Led me through each salvo
Told me my worth was set
Given me my fair share
And given me a place to hide

When I'm too baptized
I hear the parable
Jesus says, "You can follow the trails of mania
But you can never know the river of salvation."

When I'm baptized
I hear the tale
Jesus
