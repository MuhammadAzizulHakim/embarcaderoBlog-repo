======================================== SAMPLE 79 ========================================
I'm haunted by a dream
That someone else
Was there in the house
So I could have known
All along
The truth hurts
But I'm shaking so strong
To see him again

Someone has to be wrong
And silence is the best
Hope for the day when he dies

Haunting visions in the rain
Captured in my silence
Helpless victims of the rains
Fall still again

Soldier of Fortune
The envious warrior
Is never more

Promises made in vain
In the pouring rain
Some would lead all to nowhere
Others would climb the tree
And snuff out the storm
Clouds would fall over us all
And nobody would dare to stand

Outside the weak and the broken
She had given up hope
She had given up on misery
She had stopped being me
And now she found she had found her

"Wreath"

Silence disguised as a sigh
Like a burden soothed
By designating those around her
Who would listen instead of the truth
Those who would question
How she learned to survive
This distrust and dismay are signs of her love

Hoping that this step will help restore
Her to her former self
She once was afraid to walk away
She learned to walk away
She no longer regrets
The scars that linger in her past
And this step will help restore her to her former self

Signs too many years
Profound in her grief
While searching for a new home

Signs too many years
Profound in her grief
While searching for a new home

Signs too many years
Profound in her grief
While searching for a new home

Signs too many years
Profound in her grief
While searching for a new home

"Spring MCMLXXIV"

On a wind that's sailing through the morning
I can't help feeling
The need for more
And the need to breathe
There's a silence that's deafening
The air is sinking like a stone

Without love there's no reason
There's no reason to be hopeful
There's no reason to be hopeful

There's more to us than we see now
With the fields we move in
Without love there's no reason
There's no reason to be hopeful
There's no reason to be hopeful

"Shesmovedon"

I don't wanna be here
And the songs I listen to
All sound like vanilla snares
But I like the songs that I hear
As those days are fading away

So many choices to make
And what I choose to believe

The choices which have kept me sane
So far ahead of my time
So far behind the wheel

If there's a turning point
And the balance of power
Always breaks through
And the two of them
Look alike
But in reality

Neither is real
Neither holds a grudge
Neither fights the loss
Neither is left alone
Neither can't believe what he's seeing

So many options open for me
And what's left is a vast array of choices

I can't imagine why I wouldn't at least try

GT Ballard, another one has already been chosen
Go to your next hesitation
Tore up your soul
And fix your doubt

There's no turning back
Tore up your soul

Without balance
Without belief
Without choice
Without faith
Without faith

There's no turning back
Tore up your soul
And fix your doubt

There's no turning back
Tore up your soul
And fix your doubt

There's no turning back
Tore up your soul
And fix your doubt

"Flicker"

Switch off
Keep the light
On/Off
Keep the mind light
On/Off
Keep the flame alive
Keep the peace of mind

Control what you see
Keep all that light
Flicker on
Flicker on
Flicker on
Let the light go
Let the mind go

"Fading Away"

We watched the sun go down
Upon our walls
As we passed the grave
Some of our best friends will be there to see us

Buffalos and wine by the glass
Voices through the still
The cogs go round to trip
And death is never more my friend

<|endoftext|>

"Fading Away"

I'm feeling down
I'm fading
From a good night stand

Hollow walls and dim lights
Have kept me from going to sleep

The poetry keeps me sane
