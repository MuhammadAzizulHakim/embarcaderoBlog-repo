======================================== SAMPLE 44 ========================================
Follow me through the streets of this hopeless world
They are full of fear and unrest, naked rage and dumbfounded faith
They dare not glance at me with open arms
They are full of danger, full of doubt and loathing
Attractive they seem to us, devoid of self-control

They are full of doubt and unrest, naked rage and dumbfounded faith
They dare not glance at me with open arms

Attractive they seem to us, devoid of self-control

"Disappear"

We made the world believe we didn't care
We sold our soul to make a record

We ditched the wheel just to avail ourselves
We lost all faith and self-control
Just detach yourself from yourself and move on

Nothing is new here underneath my mask
Nothing is new here beneath my mask
Nothing is new here beneath my mask

"Surrender To Reason"

We surrender to reason
We accept our fate
We defy the will of reason

Born of circumstance
Starts from nothing
Desert in my eye
Endures nothing but darkening my dark

In the absence of solid reason
Nothing is new here beneath my mask
Nothing is new here beneath my mask
Nothing is new here beneath my mask

"The Betrayal Of Reason"

[I. The Bigger Picture]

By tying my life to this film
I've exposed the darkness inside
And saved my soul in the blink of an eye

The Bigger Picture
Opens the gateways to heaven
To witness the swift destruction
Of the Chosen One
Through open arms

Through faith and reason
Martyr's price be found

The Bigger Picture
Opens the gateways to heaven
To witness the swift destruction
Of the Chosen One
Through open arms

"Honor Thy Father"

Honor thy Father is good
As all of us are
Under this earthly hood
Good behavior
Beating heart disease

DX: What is the most serious medical problem you know?
A: I don't think it's heart disease
Mild mannered
Out of control

Take my money, kill me
I'm sick and tired of this fight
You're the lone voice
Disappear and help me
Take my time, I'm blind

[II. Blindness]

Way off the beaten track
There's no turning back

Can't see, hear and feel

All my matter is relative
Sorted into three temporary blind spots
One informational and one spiritual
Accessibly

Crawling to my glass prison
A place where I belong
Nothing is off limits
Nothing is off limits

I'm counting down the minutes
Drawing lines through the air
While pretending to be a man
I am not a man
And no-one will care unless I show I've actually been

Into the glass prison complex
I'm counting down the minutes
Drawing lines through the air
While pretending to be a man
I am not a man
And no-one will care unless I show I've actually been

Do you remember that time you took my money?
You saved me from my sins
And put me through another place
That gave so much more than you realize

You can't erase what you've done
You can't erase what you've done
But don't give me your money

I can't erase what you've done
I can't erase what you've done
But don't give me your money
I'm counting down the minutes
Drawing lines through the air
While pretending to be a man
I am not a man
And no-one will care unless I show I've actually been

Do you remember that time you took my money?
You saved me from my sins
And put me through another place
That gave so much more than you realize

You can't erase what you've done
You can't erase what you've done
But don't give me your money
I'm counting down the minutes
Drawing lines through the air
While pretending to be a man
I am not a man
And no-one will care unless I show I've actually been

"Behind The Veil"

What would possess you to justify
Such dark and twisted ways?
What kind of monster would feed upon this weakness?
Such a selfish, selfish devil!

And you would never seek the truth
In your twisted mind

Prophets, politicians, lieutenants
Prose doctors, psychiatrists
Helpless children
