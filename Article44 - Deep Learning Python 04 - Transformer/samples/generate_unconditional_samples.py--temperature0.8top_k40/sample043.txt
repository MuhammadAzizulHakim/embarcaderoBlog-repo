======================================== SAMPLE 43 ========================================
I met with her at the lake
She told me that if I bring rain down on her lake, it will die
Asking me where my heart is
She then turned to me, said "Sir, why don't you come tell me about
Your father's comet?"

I said, "It has been a while...
"

"I know the feeling
I have been hiding it from you for years
Don't worry, I will get used
You will know the feeling
Just take it as you will and go
Tell me what it is you want to say
And how it all began...
"

So tell me
did something happen
that you don't believe
and
Now I know the feeling
I have been hiding it from you for years
Don't worry, I will get used
You will know the feeling
Just take it as you will and go

So tell me
did something happen
that you don't believe
and
Now I know the feeling
I have been hiding it from you for years
Don't worry, I will get used
You will know the feeling
Just take it as you will and go

Tell me

I have been hiding it from you for years
Don't worry, I will get used
You will know the feeling
Just take it as you will and go

"Lie"

Daybreak
at the bottom of lake
it's a hundred degrees I can't breathe
And I won't get out
'til I figure it out
Though I'm weak like I can't believe
So you tell me 'trust me' l can trust you
Just let me show you
But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt
'cause I don't know if I know you

Doing fine but don't waste my time
Tell me what it is you want to say
You sin, you win, just let me in - hurry
I've been out in the rain all day
So you tell me 'trust me' I can trust you
as far as I can throw you
And I'm trying to get out of a shadow of doubt
'cause I don't know if I know you

Don't tell me you wanted me
Don't tell me you thought of me
I won't, I swear I won't
(Did)
I'll try, I swear I'll try
(Lie)

Mother Mary quite contrary
Kiss the boys and make them wary
Things are getting just a little bit scary
It's a wonder I can still breathe

Never been much of a doubting Thomas
but nothing breaks like a broken promise
You tell me 'bout your two more coming
but once is just enough for me

Don't tell me you wanted me
Don't tell me you thought of me
I won't, I swear I won't (did)
I'll try, I swear I'll try (lie)

I had gotten used to being a soul destroyed
She comes in apparently to fill the void
All dogs need a leash and
at least I'll forget it
And she would never hurt me though
she's never said it
But I'm not gonna ask her today
I don't wanna scare her away
Your town, I'm all alone
and I just can't stare at the phone
I wanna talk about lifelong mistakes
and you can tell your stepfather I said so

"Lifting Shadows Off A Dream"

He seems alone and silent
thoughts remain without an answer
Afraid and uninvited
he slowly drifts away

Moved by desire and fear
Breaking delicate wings

Lifting shadows
off a Dream once broken
She can turn a drop of water
Into an ocean

As the rain is pouring down
Tears of sorrow wash his mind
Drifting with the current
This stream of life flows on

He seems alone and silent
waiting on his hands and knees
The chill of winter's darkness sits quietly

Moved by desire and fear
he takes a few steps away

Lifting shadows
off a Dream once broken
She can turn a drop of water
Into an ocean

And she listens openly

He pours his soul into the water
reflecting the mystery
She carries him away
and the winds die slowly

And she listens openly
And she listens openly

Lifting shadows
off a Dream once broken
She can turn a drop of water
Into an ocean

Lifting Shadows off a Dream
Lifting Shadows off a Dream
