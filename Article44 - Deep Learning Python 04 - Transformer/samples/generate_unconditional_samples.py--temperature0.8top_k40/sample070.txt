======================================== SAMPLE 70 ========================================
my friend

I'm counting down the hours
As I try to remember...
I can't remember how
He died
But still lives
Inside my ghost

How can I know when to cry
When to sigh
And when to smile?

This feeling
Shines inside my heart

Embracing you is a must
For weathered armor
That stands on end

Your smile reflects our needs
A crimson glow
Or a lonely night
A sorrow celebration

It's a fate that we couldn't ask you to give
A parting gift that leaves your mark
On the turning stone

"In The Mist She Was Standing"

Seven milestones...
Under a watching autumn eye
Contorted trees are spreading forth
The message of the wind

With frozen hands I rode with the stars

With anger the wind blew
Giving wings to my stallion
Clouds gathered across the moon
Messenger of hope I am

"The Lullaby"

[INT. Ravenskill Rebel Command - Night]

[Arhys:]
As fearless leader of the Ravenskill
One that I swore to see,
And one that would stand by her
I am afraid to be certain
That she will remain
In this forest of her dreams
And never forgotten

[Daryus:]
My dear brother, your death will be sudden
It is forecast for the night
As my brother gave his all

[Ensemble:]
People, can't wait to see their brother again

[Sleeping Giant:]
This battle won't go down without a fight
I know we'll be fighting again
We'll be immortal

We sing the song of freedom
But we fearless warriors
Fight to give back

We are legion
We are warrior

We sing the song of freedom
But we fearless warriors
Fight to give back

We are immortal
We sing the song of freedom
But we fearless warriors
Fight to give back

"The Apostle In Triumph"

[INT. Ravenskill Fortress - Day]

[Faythe:]
The apostle in triumph
America waits for them to arrive
Tell them their faith has sworn allegiance
To them too

[Ramblings:]
To see their savior
Through the emperor's enigma
Now they know that they know him

[Sleeping Giant:]
One of their own
Took some time to herself
Topless in the sun
Eyes open to millions

[Ensemble:]
People, can you hear us?
The apostle in triumph
America waits for them to arrive
Tell them their faith has sworn allegiance
To them too

[Ramblings:]
To see their savior
Through the emperor's enigma
Now they know that they know him

[Solo: Faythe]

"I Claive Her"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Faythe:]
As her lover
Does she see him now?
Her pride, its gone
Its gone for all that he cares

[Voice of Mirror:]
Who would wish this on our son?
We cannot regret this turn of phrase
Yet the moment we chose to turn it,
It had to be our own.
Why did I come to this conclusion?
Why did I choose this turn of phrase?

I have always felt respected and believed in
This feeling
I've been waiting for some sort of fame
Not having much of a left angle in me

[Voice of Mirror:]
You see I got along so well with some of my best friends
Now they know that they too are mine
It's only a matter of time

[Turn Of The Screw:]

If they see me now they will know that I am not them
They have no doubt about believing that
I dwell within their narcissism

Weakness starting to erase all my lies
Hope starting to fail
I've found the strength to carry on
With this one little step I can take

Until I'm no longer them I don't let them go
And I won't stop them from returning
Only when they choose to listen
And after that
There's nothing left to hide
I'm hiding somewhere
I'm losing myself

[Faythe:]
I'm feeling better now
I know I'm not alone in

I could not keep away from this place
Even when I woke up
In the darkness of my dreams I saw
The face of my life
Just like a bad dream

I could not keep away from this place
Even when I woke up
In the darkness
