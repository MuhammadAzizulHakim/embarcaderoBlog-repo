Shadows are moving in from the darkness
Reaching for the rest

"Isolation Years"

There's a sense of longing in me
As I read Rosemary's letter
Her writing's honest
Can't forget the years she's lost

In isolation
She talks about her love
And as I read
"I'll die alone"
I know she was aching

There's a certain detail seen here
The pen must have slipped to the side
And left a stain
Next to his name
She knows he's gone

And isolation
Is all that would remain
"The wound in me is pouring out
To rest on a lover's shore"

"Soldier Of Fortune"

[Deep Purple cover]

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And have always been
A sense of longing is running through my soul
I've seen the light at the end of the tunnel
I still look on as Fortune

I was raised in a '67 Bugatti
By a father who thought it was the future
And mother who was stuck between

I came to understand
As the world changed from simple to empire
The world changed from premonition controlled by dreams
To face at any cost.

I've always believed
That life is but a dream
And if we wake up from the dead
We will see bright
Tomorrow is yet another day

"Napalm Dick"

The train pulls into the darkened silence
Empty and stained, the windows glass begins to crumble
The curtains fall down
And the curtains fall down again

The night is still young
And white
With the yearning for more
In the years to come

I would wait for him inside
Though I thin air upon his cold breath

The bed is unmade
And the walls are clad with fabric
And the pages are torn in two
Chimera dust and tumble dry
The only light at the end of the tunnel is a cigarette

The curtains fall down
And the curtains fall down again

"Flicker"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light to come
Only the people who always think they know best

"Bonnie The Cat"

Can't feel the pain that I expected
I still place keys in the ignition
I know what will be
One thought is stopping me from sleeping
I saw the future and it's breeding
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

There are three things that I would die for
But I am sure you're not one of them
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

There are many things that I would die for
But I am sure you
