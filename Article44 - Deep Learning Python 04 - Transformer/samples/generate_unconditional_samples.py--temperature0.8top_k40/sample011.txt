======================================== SAMPLE 11 ========================================
Seasons change...
And nothing ever lasts
So learn the hard way

[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".]
"I thought you could control life, but it's not like that. There are things you can't control."
"…and I hate to tell you how I hate to be around people who don't like me. It's just wrong. It's just wrong. It's gotta be, you know…"

Now I'm finding it, I'm loving it, I'm loving it
Now I'm finding it, I'm loving it
I'm not fighting, I'm not losing any more
I'm just living life and serenity
Now I gotta deal with this shit alone

You tell me 'trust me' l can trust you
Just stop the show
Don't tell me you wanted me
Because I'm trying to find my own voice
And I'm not willing to face this shit alone

You tell me 'trust me' I can trust you?
Trust me with evidence?
Well, cold, water, and signs
You tell me 'trust me' you can trust me
But is there really a need here?
I just don't understand
You tell me 'trust me'
And would you really want me
If you didn't exist?

You tell me 'trust me'
And would you really want me
If you didn't exist?

You tell me 'trust me'
And would you really want me
If you didn't exist?

You tell me 'trust me'
And would you really want me
If you didn't exist?

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm pulled down on my luck
The adjutant d'you tell me 'trust me'
Then he starts choking me on my com

I'm sitting on the ceiling
Eyes are bleeding bad from not enough oxygen
He begins choking me again
This time on my luck

Out of an ivory tower
She looks on in fascination
I`m told that he can`t see you
But as a god he has given you a better view

Heightening the pain
By a factor of a million

I sit down with my son
And tell him about my life
And he says that I have been held up in the light of our shared story

I`m now the age of discretion
If you choose to utilize this discretion, you must see the film
and be subject to the same terms and conditions as all other filmgoers

Under no circumstance should you or I receive preferential treatment
unless of course, the preferential treatment is caused by a nexus between your personal life and the creation of the film
and, of course, the preferential treatment is caused by a reason
that you do not understand
or is not willing to answer.

"The Lover In The Skies"

I was hoping that this would be the turning point
as I behold the virgin longing
that is the flood
and I would welcome the possibility of returning
to feel the bliss that is life
as I wrote down these words on the beach:

"Let it go"
I would scream if I thought I would
If I wound up in Arizona or somewhere
And I would hurt no-one nobody would care
No I am not leaving here anymore
I am not leaving here anymore
Just me and you
Nothing is new, nothing is new
It's just another day, nothing rises
Just another day, nothing rises

I wrote you down
And projected contortions on the beach
So I gave you my will and turned the water blue
So I took your money and turned the water blue
I didn't want to lose you
I'm tired of waiting
Nothing is new, nothing is new
It's just another day, nothing is new
It's just another day, nothing is new

Now wait it out.

"Fear Of A Blank Planet"

Sunlight coming through the haze
No gaps in the blinds
To let it inside
The bed is unmade,
Some music still plays

TV, yeah, so long
The scissors I'm using
Are still on the bed

TV, yeah,
