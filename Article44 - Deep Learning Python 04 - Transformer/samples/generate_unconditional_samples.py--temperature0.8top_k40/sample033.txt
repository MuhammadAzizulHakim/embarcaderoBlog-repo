======================================== SAMPLE 33 ========================================
I tried...

I tried...

[Imperial Guards:]

Our mission...

Is toiling away,
Comrades!

They're sworn to the light
Of life and death
Fighting for the cause
That comforts the lonely
Those who can't seem to stay still

We're children of the Earth
And the path we chose
Was one we'll walk on.

[Imperial Guards:]

We're bound to follow
Our own twisted tales
And as you're facing down the scale,
One's hearing
Deep within the bitterness

We're fighting for the cause
That we can all laugh
At the same time

We're children of the Earth
And the path we chose
Was one we'll walk on.

[Dance with fire]

[Arhys:]

You dare to stand
Before the Earth is aware
And the voices that call you to mind

[Earthquake:]

No longer can we bide our time
While our savior's risen
To stand strong
Before the last beacon of hope

[Theh synchroniculum:]

One thing remains
Before the day that one lives
And the words on her lips
Conviction made aware

[Omniscient:]

I cannot tolerate
Or be bound by any of the rules she set

I won't trust her or win the admiration
That feeds her will
To believe in nothing

I stand ready to help
If it's in need

I can't remember when
But she do her best
Gun down a threatening man
And maybe she'll find the strength
To save him
And maybe not

[Arhys:]

They'll never know what hope gives
And healing pain caresses their skin

"When Fear Is My Disease"

[ENGLISH:]
When Fear is my disease
When it's my faith
I'll be the first one
To give my son
And cure her of what it's like

She's lost her looks
She's lost her pride
Her dark magic
can she rid the world of what it's like?

When I'm blamed for her woes
I'm blamed far too long

She's lost her wit
Her drive for change
smashed
and broken

When her surrounds keep snapping
I'm praised as the savior
She can cure any whoidget
With a price tag of her own

When her surrounds keep snatching
I'm praised as the one who set the template
She can help to guide us all to
Our salvation
She can't shoulder the task alone
Help us be saved from this
Trapped in our rituals

When her surrounds keep tearing
I'm praised as the one who set the template
She can help to guide us all to
Our salvation
She can't shoulder the task alone
Help us be saved from this
Trapped in our rituals

"Scarred"

To Rise, To Fall.
To Hurt, To Hate.
To Want, To Wait.
To Heal, To Heal

Can't hear the sound of my daughter's voice
I'm sending her away
Can't trust her for what she's worth

Can't stop the flow of life when she cries
It's not enough for me
I need more than that
I can't go beyond now
When all my dreams are shattered
And leave all my questions behind

Where do I belong when the days are late?
When I can't remember a word when I have to carry on
Are we closer than before?

Where do we belong when the bitter cold is so good?
When all my dreams are shattered
And leave all my questions behind

And how come my sadness never seems to disappear?
When all my dreams are shattered
And leave all my questions behind?

Where do we belong when the bitter cold is so good?
When all my dreams are shattered
And leave all my questions behind

"Sever"

Telepath Carbon trapped under stone
Brother mother pale body is thrown
Only way I know to have fun
Fill up my blood, my veins, my lungs

ESP city - rainy and blue
Burn down this town, I give it to you
Aero shallow, photograph blind
Stage fright, black light, coma divine

No sense of time
Sever tomorrow
Exitless mind - ESP Sever tomorrow

School out invective, losing my voice
Film shredding on in multiple choice
America calls, I must go
Oprah saviour, I feel that low

I cannot believe my eyes
Being from out
