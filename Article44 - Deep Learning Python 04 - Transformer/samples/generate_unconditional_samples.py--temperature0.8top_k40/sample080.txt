======================================== SAMPLE 80 ========================================
This is my last chance
To save my son
This chance seems endless

I'm kneeling at the site
Where once night was a thing
And yesterday a dream is a thing.
It always burns within me
To see the dawning of a simple but beautiful arrangement

You were always my own man
How fortunate for a moment
To have found me
And now embrace the day
As we walk through this door
We will both know
Our fate in heaven

As I walk away
I am no longer a man
But I am free
There is nothing left
After all, this day has begun

"Light Fuse And Get Away"

Would you like to sit and talk to me
about the way things change so
suddenly
when your senses come and the feeling
goes?
can you remember feeling much
too close?

Stop your hands from shaking.
Look at me.
Are your senses racing endlessly
tracing
past impressions? So were mine.
Have you ever been used
or will this be the first time?

It's come so clear to me
Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
It's a fatal game
and my only friend
to lose

I can't shake this feeling
I can't stand to lose

My sense of time
allows me to see far too
past
too late
my head is so exposed
I need to leave to enjoy the ride

Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
It's a fatal game
and my only friend
to lose

"My Ashes"

As I'm reaching for the flame
I'm reaching for the light
I'm reaching for the truth
I'm reaching for the peace of mind

Still they bathe in the moonlight
And I rubbed them on my skin
Rising above the grave

The ashes in the hand I found a way to save my soul
I found hope in faith

And faith in humanity
weeps through the heat of battle
and through the darkness of love

Still they bathe in the moonlightAnd I rubbed them on my skin
Rising above the grave

The ashes in the hand I found a way to save my soul
I found hope in faith

And faith in humanity
weeps through the heat of battle
and through the darkness of love

Still they bathe in the moonlightAnd I rubbed them on my skin
Rising above the grave

The ashes in the hand I found a way to save my soul
I found hope in humanity

"War Of The Worlds"

The moon is blue and I can see
It is your turn
Look me up
Linked by a light
and let me know that I am the world
now

Foot in mouth and head down
Drifting in to a safe place
And I'm waiting for you
It's calling me back to my home

Moment of truth
the end of an era
found a way into this life
War of the worlds

My wheels in the dirt
I'm riding high
On a fucking World Series run
I crash and burn

Moment of truth
the end of an era
found a way into this life
War of the worlds

My wheels in the dirt
I'm riding high
On a fucking World Series run
I crash and burn

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My hand was too far gone

Don't ever leave me feeling alone
I know you'll never want me again
So come Messiah show me how you belong
Message to mankind that we belong

"All In One Snow"

All in one snow
We lost all sense of yearning
We became all in one
Everything is growing out of control
I can't keep doing what I'm doing
All in one snow what am I doing?

Summer's gone and I'm drifting,
Where do I begin to find the peace I belong?

The way you smell when you're alone
The way you speak brings me to tears
And the way you kiss and smile
It brings tears to my eyes
And the way you talk makes me feel better

Summer's gone and I'm drifting,
Where do I begin to find the peace I belong?
