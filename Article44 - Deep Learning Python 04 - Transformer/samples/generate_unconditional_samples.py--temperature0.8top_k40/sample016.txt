"Don't Hate Me"

A light snow is falling on London
All sign of the living has gone
The train pulls into the stations
And no-one is waiting to stop me

I'm making my way to reach out and comfort me
I'm reaching for love with all my heart
And no-one is waiting to stop me

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't fight me
I know I'm not the same as you

When I'm reaching for love
I'm reaching for life
And no-one is waiting
To love me or not to love me

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't fight me
I know I'm not the same as you

When I'm reaching for love
I'm reaching for life
And no-one is waiting
To love me or not to love me

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't fight me
I know I'm not the same as you

"Blackest Eyes"

A light snow is falling on London
All sign of the living has gone
The train pulls into the stations
And no-one is waiting to stop me

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't fight me
I know I'm not the same as you

When I'm reaching for love
I'm reaching for life
And no-one is waiting
To love me or not to love me

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't fight me
I know I'm not the same as you

"Surrounded"

Floating on mist
Controlling my thoughts
Eating through days
Snuffing the first sound

Eating out the first crumbs
Plunging into the second
Flanked into the third
Tempting my caress
An invitation to fall

Surrounded

Always comforting
Crying my name
A reminder toodds through the haze
Always reminding me ofmystical peril

Through tongued fists
The choking flame
Must keep me sane
Until I'm choking pizza
I'm begging you for something
To save me
From my own existence

"Shallow"

I don't remember
Did something in my past create a hole?
Don't use your credit cards
For crowding out fraud

I live in disbelief
If I say I own the sound
Then all of my friends will
Turn their lights down

Shallow
Feel like donating
To curb the flow of death

Shallow
Feel like donating
To curb the flow of death

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

Sacrifice my life
Neglect my kids and wife
All for you to be happy
All those sleepless nights
And countless fights to give you more
And then you say how dare that
I didn't write you back
I must be too good for you
I only care about myself

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough
