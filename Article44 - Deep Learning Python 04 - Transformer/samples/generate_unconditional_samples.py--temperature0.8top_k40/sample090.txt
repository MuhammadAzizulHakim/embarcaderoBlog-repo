"Gravity Eyelids"

I used to be amazed at how clean and clear life can be
Now I was transfixed on a dream
I lay awake in the night
I wondered what had become of my sense of smell
And what had become of my sense of taste

My clothes slipped into a river while I was still young
My guts inside a car
My devotion underground

My blood on a radiator
My lips on a wine bottle
My withered spirit inside a fire
Mysing under the sun
My neck was burning hot
I shed skin for the worse

My brother in law, the man who had given me everything
Told me how glad I am to see him again
The way he looked at me when I told him my story
After all the fun they had in a common cold
I said I hated myself for being someone else
And I should learn to survive on my own
With my brother's blood on a radiator
My chops on a cutting machine
My skin is an open wound
An open wound means I'm no longer welcome
This wicked stepfather made me a sacrifice
I'm too smart when he kills his son
I'm too smart when he makes me his body

I'm drained from everything
So I let my heart be the sole reason
And I'm giving up on everything
Now I find that draining
I'm the envy of the world
I'm the death of suburbia

"Flicker"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light to come
Only the people who always think they know best

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light to come
Only the people who always think they know best

"Bonnie The Cat"

Can't feel the pain that I expected
I still place keys in the ignition
I know what will be
One thought is stopping me from sleeping
I saw the future and it's breeding
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

There are three things that I would die for
But I am sure that you will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

[Whispered:]
You think you know best
When you hear this song
Bonnie The Cat, your sleeping giant
Will you die for us or for the Others?

"Black Dahlia"

You have no interest in the past
Where you came from
Where you're going to

There's a cliche in your eye
File the edges away
Soon you'll be free

There's nothing sacred
Never accepting blame
For the victims of a crime

You're a bad motherfucker
You're a bad motherfucker
You're a bad motherfucker

And there's nothing left for you to take
When you feel like you don't care
There's a cliche in your eye
File the edges away
Soon you'll be free

There's nothing sacred
Never accepting blame
For the victims of a crime

You're a bad motherfucker
You're a bad motherfucker
You're a bad motherfucker
You're a bad motherfucker
You're a bad motherfucker

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden of our shared griefs
Open wounds hidden under our skin

Pain is real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Staring at me crying

[CHORUS]
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I sever myself from the world
and shut down completely
All alone in my own living hell
overcome with irrational fear

Under the weight of the world on my chest
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath
Tell me I'm not dying

[CHORUS]
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I'm a burden and a travesty
I'm a prisoner of regret
Between the flashbacks and the violent dreams
I am hanging on the edge

Disaster lurks around the bend
Paradise came to an end
And no
