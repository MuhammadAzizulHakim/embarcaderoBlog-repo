======================================== SAMPLE 23 ========================================
They have left me rifled through
Somebody has to die
There's no turning back

I'm left behind
Like all the others
Some fall for you
It doesn't make much difference who they are

She changes every time you look
By summer it was all gone - now she's moved on
She said goodbye to her life
With her was a kingdom - she'll always be
She gave me a key to the kingdom
In summer it all came crashing down
Ripped from my hands - my blood froze white
And all I could do was stare
She turned away into the distance

"In The Mist She Was Standing"

The sun was waving goodbye
She had just reached her final year
When she would just leave me be

She's come to this moment
To live and travel again
She's just a girl
Attractive and thin
She's getting older
But she's finding courage
In her words

"My love is strong here
Don't let it fade away"

[Miracle:]
I'm sitting in the concrete
It's all red and blue
Trying to break through
Trying to hold on
And remember
I gave you life
It's all gone now

I can see you
Standing there alone
With no one by your side
Are you afraid of losing your love?

[Hope:]
I'm sitting in the painting
I've come to find
The answer lies within

[Miracle:]
I'm sitting in the window
Icing up to his stare
I don't wanna be ignored
No matter what
There's more to us than we see

[Henry:]
I don't think it's fair
Don't blame me
Not all of the disasters
Have been and will befall
All of you
There's more to us than we see

"Messenger Of God"

There's a voice calling for us to follow
Beyond the silence of our own homes
Come witness this spiritual communion
Through a spiritual father and a spiritual mother
For their salvation is proof
Of fruits and for our salvation is a cure
Of all sins is proof
Of love is proof
Of life is proof
Of worship is proof
Of life is proof
Of worship is proof
Of life is proof
Of life is proof
Of life is proof
Of life is proof
Of life is proof
Of life is proof
Of life is proof
Of life is proof
Of life is proof
Of life is proof
Of life is proof
Of life is proof

"Out Of Reach"

There's something about this girl
Some kind of magic
Swear she cast a spell on me

Not the first time
Might be the last
Can't let this moment slip away
Keep my heart still and let the story unfold

Try to recall words
A line from my mouth
Aborted in our land of Arhys

Still I fret over how I look when I dream
I'm too comfortable in my skin

Sad to think I never will
Been here before you all
Told me how I feel when I'm sweating
And how I wanna stay forever

Out of reach
Just too low
Lead me through every tough scene

Try to remember lines from my mouth
A line from my mouth
Aborted in our land of Arhys

Still I'm bored
Still I wish I didn't know
When will this end?

"FaythefactshesthatLookedLikeMe"

She always wakes up
Only to find she'd been there before
Only five minutes have expired
Only girl in all the textbooks
Who doesn't love her?

And still she sucks it up like a fiddle
Fill the empty hole like a zombie
And play fetch with the dead

Nothing ever happens
But it always ends
No matter how hard she tries

Everytime I press a key
There's a loop that keeps coming back
And she knows it's the key to heaven

And she always wakes up
Only to find she'd been there before
Only five minutes have expired
Only girl in all the textbooks
Who doesn't love her?

FaythefactshestheLookedLikeMe

I'm waiting for her
I'm staring at the sky
And she's waiting and she's waiting
I'm waiting for her like me

"Anna Lee"

Helpless child
They invite the world to tears
She cries - sometimes she's in the rain

Don't tell her
Don't tell her
