I feel now like Christine Keeler

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night]

[Arhys:]
As fearless leader of the Rebel
One of the most feared and sought after
X is with his family
And at peace I'm bound to live by his memory

I am with you tonight
I will not leave your side
I am with you tomorrow

Arhys beckons you
To bow and salute his light
Arhys begs you
To bow and salute his light

[Xander:]
When I see your face
Every morning I'm led through the dark
By the angel's face

[Daryus:]
When I see your face
Every morning I'm led through the dark
By the angel's face

[Gabriel:]
As fearless leader of the Rebel
One of the most feared and sought after
X is with his family
And at peace I'm bound to live by his memory

[Arhys:]
On the road to revolution
We're bound to make mistakes
But who's right
And left will never be the same

[Daryus:]
When I see your face
Every morning I'm led through the dark
By the angel's face

"A New Beginning"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Faythe:]

Father I implore you
Don't believe a word
He is not the enemy
That is just absurd

I cannot tolerate
he considers me an enemy

Give me one more chance
And I will give him everything
He is just a man
Can't tolerate
he is just a man

[Arabelle:]

You dare to stand
Before my eyes
You're one of them
Why would I trust you?

[Faythe:]

Of course I am
Of course I am
Of course I am
Of course I am
Of course I am
Of course I am
Of course I am

"The Path That Divides"

[EXT. Heaven's Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Narrator:]

Out of the shadows
One by one they came
To shed their light upon his moment of doubt and pain

A thousand voices
Rang out through the night
Ranging from heartfelt to tearful

[Gabriel:]

I know you're scared and alone
But we will listen to you now
If we only knew
Who you are
And let you be

Into the night
Follow me

Into the night
Follow me

Follow me
Into the night
Follow me

"The Passion Of The Soul"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Night]

[Nafaryus:]

Father, my pride will never go away
It never will without you
It always costs me
To live with the past
Until you're gone
The sight and the words that once filled me
Will never be the same

[Arabelle:]

I will always love you
Until we meet again
The Passion of the soul
That spark inside of me
Will never go away

[Daryus:]

Gabriel, my son and heir
Can you remember the first time you saw that face in your dreams?
That was the moment
When your father's hand had found its way
To signal your betrayal
And my fear and loathing was gone

[Narrator:]

Arabelle, can you remember the first time you saw that face in your dreams?
That was the moment
That fateful night
When the man in the mirror
Must have felt her presence,
He saw her flickering on the wall
And all of the sudden
She flashed
Me standing next to you

[Nafaryus:]

She was the one
That would bring the day
To when she would light you up
And tell you how glad she is to see you

[Narrator:]

She was right
Cause she was right

[Faythe:]

My love for you has long since faded
And my fear and loathing is gone

[Arabelle:]

You are a part of my life
And I am glad that you choose to live
Through this moment I know you're ready
To face the bitter fight
That is mine alone

[Daryus:]

You are a part of my life
And I am glad that you choose to live
Through this moment I know you're ready
To face the bitter fight
That is mine alone

And I know you well
So why
