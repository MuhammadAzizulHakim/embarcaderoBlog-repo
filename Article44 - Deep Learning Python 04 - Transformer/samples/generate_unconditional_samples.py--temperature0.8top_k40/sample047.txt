And I'm bleeding again
Life is short, can't take another day

I'm lying here in the concrete
Deadly laughter and violent desires
Giving me life, giving me life
And I'm lying here in the concrete
Deadly laughter and violent desires
Giving me life, giving me life
And I'm lying here in the concrete
Deadly laughter and violent desires
Giving me life, giving me life
And I'm lying here in the concrete

"The Patient"

A groan of tedium escapes me,
Startling the fearful.
Is this a test? It has to be,
Otherwise I can't go on.
Draining patience, drain vitality.
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old.

But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith,
And I'm lying here in the concrete
Deadly laughter and violent desires
Giving me life, giving me life
And I'm lying here in the concrete

Yes, I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith,
And I'm lying here in the concrete

"Charlatan"

[Spoken word, ramblings:]
"Who is God? What is God?"
"That's a tricky question!" "I don't believe in God!"
"Do you believe in God?" "No" "Why would I?"

Three thousand dreams in pale moonlight
Counting...
Three thousand years of Winter's blight
Ticking off against my heart

Here come the months of squalor
Clasp death in his parlor
A sorrow celebration
She canes a thousand creations

Three hundred days in an endless night
The frost smiles
Three hundred weapons on manhunt
Craving more blood to its name

Here come the months of squalor
Clasp death in his parlor
A sorrow celebration
She canes a thousand creations

Cities, violated graves
Yonder distance, perfect slave
You!

[Spoken word:]
"God, God, God…is God his name?"
"No, Jesus!" "Is there only one God?" "No"
"How many are there?" "30 million and hundreds of thousands!"
"Wow!" "There's one in each country" "OK!"
"Can they speak to each other?"
"…No!"

[Ramblings:]
"He can fly and only has one head"
"People say that he's watching over us from up there…"
"On a moon image" "One dies"
"There is no right or wrong"
"What do you think happens when one dies?"
"…I guess I think that one will remain in one's grave, kind of…"

"Universal Truth"

Sweat on the brow runs over faces made of snow
There comes a time in life when death may seem like the wrong thing to do

But misery is never within our control
We're not powerless
We're not waiting for you
We're not waiting for you

People tell me what to do
and how to live
but never how to die
There's no time, no doubt
So I take my own life
and ignore all the others

"Self-Sacrifice"

Work hard to get by
Never want to think of losing you again

Keep your pride at bay
Keep your thoughts and your questions
Straight out of your head

You're reaching for the silver bullet
Never really thinking about losing you again

You're cutting yourself deep in the forest
And leaving behind scars
All over your face

Shedding your voice out on the net
While preserving your truth

Find your place in the world
and be heard
coming out the other side

You're slipping back into the wilderness
While losing yourself deeper

You're growing older and thinner,
and your sense of place
feeling the coldness of defeat

You're hiding all of your anger and pain
With nowhere to turn

You're anywhere but here
You're sinking like a stone
Finding your place in the world

You're swimming in the calm of modern life
But you're sinking like a stone
Finding your place in the world

Shedding your voice out on the net
While preserving your truth

Find your place in the world
and be heard
coming out the other side

You're sliding, sliding, sliding
Limiting your
