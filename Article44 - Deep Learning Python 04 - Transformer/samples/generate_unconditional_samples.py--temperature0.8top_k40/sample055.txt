======================================== SAMPLE 55 ========================================
With all my heart
In love with the weak
Without a doubt

Try to break through
Find the courage to live on your own
When all my dreams seem broken
I can't help but feel
Lost in this moment

I've found the courage to be strong
When all my dreams seem broken
I've found the courage to be strong

"Untethered Angel"

If I still had something left
I'd surely use my gift
to give her one more breath
She would allow it to make a difference
She would be wrong all along
And she would be safe from all that
She's gone and hidden
She's safe in the arms of me
She's got nothing left
She's got nothing left

And she's hiding is all I'm
Tempting, yes I'm tempted
But she can't risk angering herself
She can't risk angering herself
And anger is not on her mind
And anger is not on her mind

A second glance again
Tells her everything
Supposedly giving her the upper hand

I'm left behind
Like all the others
Others are corrupted by her
Cruel mothers, who have no mercy for the mothers of children
And all that they can do is look the other way

Unwelcome guests
Husbands barred from coming to weddings
And nowhere to lay their flowers
Some of whom died for us to see

There's a certain gravity to this
A society in your blood
Foot soldiers and guards
Of those who survived, there was a very special man

Some say a second glance is the start of the end
Certainly worthy of admiration

Blood...Heal me
Families all over
Science done forever
Enormously wealthy
While in love
While in love

"Glass Arm Shattering"

Feeling all my touching
Feeling all your blood
Feeling all your blood
Feeling all my love

Seen it through a windscreen
Seen it through the glass
Seen it through the glass

"Balanced"

Balanced on a screen
This is not reality
But it's closer than fiction
Distorted by our delirious senses

<|endoftext|>

"Contact"

Lost in the dark
As the night went on
And the angel of balance
Wore a heavy heart

Making my presence known
Sending a heavy weight behind
To raise the alarm
To anybody who'd need me most

A stifling surge
Wore down a heavy rain gale
And sent flying all across

I was left behind
Like all the others
Who've come to my funeral pyre
Disappear into the darkness

<|endoftext|>

"Dark Matter"

A drop in the ocean
A thousand dead satellites
A thief in the eye
Redemption for humanity

A drop in the ocean
A thousand dead satellites
A thief in the eye
Redemption for humanity

A drop in the ocean
A thousand dead people observing
A cry for help
A cry for help
Is the calm that we deserve

Empty pockets of wealth
Black coffers and secret societies
Allying with the weak
For domination and submission
Or any other way to end it

useless little prize pools
Distorted by our morbid fascination

The light that burns in my eyes
Blinded byproducts from the toxins in my blood
Years and years of research
Have revealed the truth of this moment

Empty pockets of wealth

"Heaven's Cove"

Over a dead candle's infernal glow
Ghosts of evil intent on his ways
Corrupting the honors he's been given
Rose up like the dead in this benighted place

In a motionless scenes worst
Hissing and choking on his own fumes
Like the dead unaware
Of his peculiarity

Sweeting a loud noose with each stumble
Confirming the never-ending vampire population
A curse upon the senses

Hissing and choking on his own fumes
Like the dead unaware
Of his peculiarity

<|endoftext|>

"Heaven's Cove"

You say you hate silence
No surprise, therefore
