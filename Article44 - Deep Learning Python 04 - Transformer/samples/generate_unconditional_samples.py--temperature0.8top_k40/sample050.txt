======================================== SAMPLE 50 ========================================
When I get tired of waiting
When I get tired of hating the ground that I have walked upon
I will move on

Moving on
Leaving
Nothing now less than the start of the end

"Time Out"

[SETTLES]

Black Sunday of sleep
(Walk through)
(You, me and you)
I'm down
All my feelings
(I, I am down)
So you tell me 'trust me' time is now
trust me I can help you
say the name of your forgiver
And time will come when the chimes are still right

She's awake
She knows
what's coming
is his coming

Tell her 'now let's take this day'
then turn it over to the Arizona Republic

Once again we're led through the magic of this quest
When the beads of sweat that tied me to this wall
now fall silent again

Clasped in my presence
All my instincts were right
and when Arizona Republic reporter Gabriel Iglesias saw
that face he turned away
because he had come to find me
he knew it was false
It was the fatal failing of my friendship
had I known him at all?

[Arhys' Spirit:]
As you can see I am the son of Arhys
and as your eyes see I am the son of Arhys

[Solo: Åkerfeldt, Åkesson]

Of course you Folks will be waiting for you
everyone will fear me
Choirs on high
Memories will burn at the stake
I am the enemy within
You can only lead the way you see fit

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Gabriel:]
As the people gather round me
I will be the first to inform them
Of my decision
To give you all life, even when it's wrong
And to give you what you need most
Is not what I thought it would be
So help me God
Give me life

As you can see I am the son of Arhys
and as you can see I am the son of Arhys

"Eternal Rains Will Come"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Faythe:]
Mother Mary quite contrary
Killed her children
Started a new life
Stayed a mother in desperate need of salvation
Now she kills her children
For Faythe sake of spite
She is the one who saves her
Now she is the one who saves her

"People's Trust"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Faythe:]
Faythe, you fear for your life.
But in faith we're all bound.
We've seen the end is now
And faith alone won't fix this
Routine pathways in the developing brain

It's not enough to pay the bills
And there's no time to forget

Look at me
I'm not the man you thought you knew
You're the man who would make you proud
And I'm the man who would satisfy your need
If only I could see him now

And I'll see him soon
He's a hero to know me
You're a reason to believe

Into the sun they sail
Outside they crash and burn
Like dreaming of the future
Far better to enjoy the past
It seems we've forgotten all about you
Now it's time to forget you

And I can't take another day
I'm tired of waiting
And I know you'll be tired of too

Until we meet again
Or meet and I'll disappear
And all our fears will fade

What if the man who claimed to be me
I thought I could change nothing?
What if I believed what I've seen
Invisible man in the mirror
Had I known then
I would never

In spite of all my efforts
Nothing will ever bring me back
And I'm tired of waiting
And I know you'll be tired of too

"Fear Inoculum"

Immunity, long overdue
Contagion, I exhale you
Naive, I opened up to you
Venom and mania
Now, contagion, I exhale you

The deceiver says, he says
You belong to me
You don't wanna breathe the light of the others
Fear the light, fear the breath
Fear the others for eternity
But I hear them now, inhale the clarity
Hear the venom, the venom in
What they say
Fear the venom
