======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
I'm looking for a way to help make my life easier
Help me be a little girl
And rid her of all her pain
I'm looking for a way
To help her forget about her pain
And give her a voice
I'm looking for a way
To help her forget about pain
And still be loved

How can I forget
How can I be loved?
How can I leave a mark?

[V. Surrounded and Bleeding]

Unconsciousening
Feeling afraid and losing control
In a flurry of smoke
I can't keep away

Listening to the city
She keeps saying
It's all crumbling brick and rubble
Then sighs with relief

I'm watching from the sidelines
I'm sobbing under the pain
Someone please come save us all

"In The Presence Of Enemies, Pt. 1"

[I Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[II Resurrection]

I saw a white light
Shining there before me
And walking to it
I waited for the end
A final vision
Promising salvation
A resurrection
For a fallen man

Do you still wait for your God
And the symbol of your faith?

I can free you from this Hell and misery
You should never be ashamed my son
I can give you power beyond anything
Trust me you will be the chosen one

I was forgotten
A body scorned and broken
My soul rejected
Tainted by his blood

Beyond redemption
A sinner not worth saving
Forever taken
From the one I loved

Do I still wait for my God
And a symbol of my faith?

I can lead you down the path and back to life
All I ask is that you worship me
I can help you seek revenge and save yourself
Give you life for all eternity

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their saviour's calling
Of this wicked day

Through a veil of madness
With a vicious blade
One man rises up
Standing in their way

Redemption
Redemption for humanity

"Forsaken"

For a while I thought I fell asleep
Lying motionless inside a dream

Then rising suddenly
I felt a chilling breath upon me
She softly whispered in my ear
(Forsaken)

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand
Give yourself up to me

I waited painfully
For night to fall again
Trying to silence the fear within me

Out of an ivory mist
I felt a stinging kiss
And saw a crimson stain on her lips

I have to know your name
Where have I seen your face before?
My dear one don't you be afraid

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand
Give yourself up to me

Take me far away
Close your eyes
And hold your breath
To the ends of the earth

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand

Forsaken
Fly away with me tonight
Awaken
Renew my life
Now you are mine
Give yourself up to me

"Constant Motion"

Tunnel vision at blinding speed
Controlling my thoughts, obsessing me
Void of any uncertainty
Throughout all that I'm feeling
I'm paralyzed in my undertow

Fading signs of life
Every foot on the stone
Is tracking me down

Detonating visions in my sleep
Scorching my memory
Every action leaves a scar
Constant motion cuts deep inside

Gazing into the moment
Finding the place I was meant to be
Sitting in place again
Eager to explore
Shivering in the midst of the best

Every step I take
Saving strength and sanity
For the greatest adventure
Through the darkest hour of the night

I'm torn between the steps of our shared dream
Lost in the second night
And the loss of everything we hold most dear

Every step I take
Saving strength and sanity
For the greatest adventure
Through the darkest hour of the night

We made our way to tears
The final word was mine

The gateways of our souls
Are often shrouded in darkness
But never so black and white
As when we were kids

Every morning I wake up with a cold blank stare
Picture the final thought running through my head

Tearing my self-control away
I'm tearing into my friendships and family
Before I have
