I've seen the path she is on
Beyond the circle of the widow
She is the one who sought me

Through the eternal flame of our eternal union
We forged a bond of distrust
Though we shook hands over news of the zenith
In her memory we made known our opposition
Though we at last reconciled
We raised our voices
To demand the ouster of our ally

In the name of the mighty
We traveled to seclusion
From the rising sun
Of our most solemn feasts

Her vision for us to carry on
And the truth for us to shed
Our beloved son

"Beneath The Surface"

Is there ever really a right time?
You had led me to believe
Sacred cowered beneath the sun
But now the time has come
Leave your mark upon the void
And join me in your wake

Beneath the surface

Endlessly
Whatever
Begged me
To search for the words
And somehow
Finally found it all

You'd taken more than we took
And now the time has come
Leave your mark upon the void
And join me in your wake

In the name of the mighty
We traveled to seclusion
From the rising sun
Of our most solemn feasts

Brave new beginning
Who weren't afraid to face her demons
Are you ready to face your own demons
When all your dreams are shattered

Willingness to understand
And helplessness to face your own demons
Are the signs of aging grace

Waiting to be forgiven

Through the flaws in our lives

Vibrant colors

tell me what it is to be human
And bright colors make me blind
And blind if I let you
Take my hand and we'll fly

Or,
Swept away

Once eyed with distrust
Now it's harmonious
Adapting to the light
Each time I see you
I'm learning
And you're forgiving
I'm learning
And I'm forgiving

"Beneath The Surface"

So far I have seen
And heard
And seen
And rejoiced in her
Rotten legacy
I'm sick of all you are
Clean and sober
Catharsis for Christ's sake

Beneath the surface

"In The Mist She Was Standing"

Were these the cries of the lost
Or the gleaming eyes of the risen?

The fierceness of her words
The thought of her lost child
The thought of reconciling
She was all I could see

The edge of her words
A frail caress and a touch of death

I would scream
If I felt her still

Could this be the betrayal that's redsaying my name?

I cried,
"Tore the Veil"
And she waited for me,
Standing by the stairs
I'd taken my leave
As the cold light of my shoes
washes over me.

I will not live under a shadow of fear
It is a burden I can't seem to bear
I must face it head on
With hope in my eyes
Ive gone to great lengths to conceal
My true identity

Walking through the narrow stone all but torn
All of my friends disappear
While Imie a slow burn

I can't help myself
The bitterness in my eyes
Is making me sick
I'm hiding well

"By The Pain I See In Others"

I can't help myself
The bitterness in my eyes
Is making me sick
I'm hiding well

I'm hiding well

I'm not sure I like this feeling
I'm trying to find my way back home
It's like my life has gone from bad to worse
I can't help myself
Just trying to get through the day

Somehow I keep getting
And it makes me feel ugly
I'm not the person you thought I'd be
When I see the bruises on your scar
You tell me you love me
And I'm not the person you thought I'd be

Somehow I keep getting
And it makes me feel ugly
I'm not the person you thought I'd be
When I see the bruises on your scar
You tell me you love me
And I'm not the person you thought I'd be

"Don't Hate Me"

A light snow is falling on London
All sign of the living has gone
The train pulls into the stations
And no-one gets off and no-one gets on

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
