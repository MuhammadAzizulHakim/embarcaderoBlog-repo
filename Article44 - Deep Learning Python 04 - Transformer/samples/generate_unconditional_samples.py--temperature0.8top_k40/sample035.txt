I can't imagine
Why we preach unity
When in fact we all long for harmony

For every American, this yearning begs Differentials

We all long for a new adventure
And salvation
When in reality we all long for a new adventure

Only God can save us all
God alone can save us all
God alone can save us all

"Visions Lost"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Gabriel:]
As your savior
he found a vision for you
ashamedly
You are not who you claim to be
and cannot be trusted

Searching home left alone
I cannot lead you into temptation
I know you'll never rule me
And I know you'll never love me
And I know you'll never love me
And I know you'll never love me
And I know you'll never love me
And I know you'll never love me
And I know you'll never love me
I am the one
I must save for you
I am the one
I must save for you
And I know you'll never love me
And I know you'll never love me
And I know you'll never love me
I am the one
I must save for you
I am the one
I must save for you
And I know you'll never love me
And I know you'll never love me
I am the one
I must save for you
I am the one
I must save for you
And I know you'll never love me
I am the one
I must save for you
I am the one
I must save for you
I am the one
I must save for you
I am the one
I must save for you
I am the one
I must save for you
I am the one
I must save for you
And I know you'll never love me
I am the one
I must save for you
I am the one
I must save for you
And I know you'll never love me

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm pulled into the story
I'm brought out of the dead

Every time I turn around
There's another voice
Speaking to me

Like a ghost in the night
Seeking my revenge
She's burning me alive

Like a madman in the wake of salvation
Eyes open wide
Am I still there or am I just a memory?

I'm pulled into the story
The enigma keeps on coming
And the weaker I get, the less I can see
The door gets painfully narrow
And the memory starts to run

And the truth is always the same
The more I live with the less I can say
The truth is always the same

Every time I turn around
There's another voice
Speaking to me

Like a ghost in the night
Seeking my revenge
She's burning me alive

"The Enemy Inside"

I can't see the truth
I'm scared of losing you
I'm scared of living with the past
I'm scared of leaving you behind

And I don't like this feeling
I'm here right where I'm supposed to be
I'm frightened of never being here
And I don't like this feeling
I'm here inside the Enemy inside

"The Rover / Achilles Last Stand / The Dark And The Silent / The reign of terror / The culling of the herd / The parting of the ways / The parting of the ways
 / The culling of the herd
The parting of the ways

I was forgotten
A day went by when I wouldntread / hid / and forgot
And I would try again
In a place called the dark and silent
The final test
Of our souls

"The Enemy Inside"

[INT. Home of Achilles Last stand and the Dark and Silent]

[Assassin:]
We have come to take him back
We have to know who he is
And why he is here

If we look no further
We will never be alone again

And there is nothing more we need
But there is nothing more we must hide

If we look no further
We will never be alone again

And there is nothing more we must hide

If we take all of you now
And let you be the one to know us
We will never be alone again
