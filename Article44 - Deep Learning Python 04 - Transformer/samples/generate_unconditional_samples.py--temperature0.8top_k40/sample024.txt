Don't want to hurt your feelings.

Don't want to hurt your feelings.

OK OK OK OK
You know what they say: If you're gonna hurt your feelings, you gotta be willing to walk the walk of hope before you're willing to walk the walk of faith.
Walk the walk of hope?

"Hope Leaves"

In the rain in here
In the park
Just across the river
Old Time is closed for good until tomorrow
The moment you born.
The moment you died.
The moment you grew up.
The moment you gave away too.

We are born again
Now the world knows
How you felt when you cried
Born again.

When I'm told that your memory
Will never be the same
And that your life is never the same
How can you ever hold onto what was yours?

I can't remember the first time
I lost all I had (that April day),
But I can't remember the last time.
I'm so glad that I now know
How you looked on to my swimming pool
And how I wished that day would end so somehow.

And how can I ever hold onto what was mine?

It's so hard to stay connected
Even when you visit such a wonderful country like the USA.
I'm sick of all the noise and of course, we will always hate you.

"The Unexpected"

Morning breaks beyond the hours of darkness
As the air is forced to a standstill
To the shock of our eyes
The night sets in
And the day goes down

Farewell is the word,
even the red faced man
With sympathy for the helpless
And for the victims of a crime

Nothing is left unguarded
Like a MemoryCard, a ticketed fugitive

Waiting for an uncertain life
There is never enough for her

Still the night is calling
And the day is still

<|endoftext|>

"Harvest"

If something good comes along
I believe in God and life
If we have faith and reason
We can make this dream a reality

Promise made in faith in God and life
If we live with our fears and condemnations

False hope, a waste of talent
A man who has faith and soul

Learn to live with your own mortality
The loss of loved ones
Can't you save them all by yourself?
You are the killer

"Persephone"

A child of autumn was born
Into a world of deceit and death
And a paradise of sorrow

She would rise from the dead
By means of music and poetry
She would build a world on her own
She would rule from the dead
By hatred and love
She would slay the weak
And build a world on her own

The mother of her children
The music teacher of her children

A mother needs her children
For the love of life
She would crush their hearts into a bowl
And feed them all cake

After all the chaos and the tears
Music and poetry are her way
Of reconciling the two

"Sval"

Sun hangs high
He is chosen
By our eyes
He watches over us all

Waiting days
For the day when we all will be

Standing next to you
We all felt the pain
Standing next to you
We all cried

Standing next to you
We all believed

Standing next to you
We all believed

Waiting days
For the day when we all will be
Standing next to you
We all felt the pain
Standing next to you

Waiting days
For the day when we all will be

Standing next to you

Standing next to you

"The Road To Revolution"

[INT. Gabriel's Hideout - Day]

[Faythe:]

He just captured and killed a man
Now he's got his hands bound
He's never heard of a man so hated

There's a high treason count going on
And there's a chance you'll be waiting
There's a chance you'll be staring down
There's a chance you'll be rotting inside

You are a danger to yourself and everyone you love
Everyone who's against you
Everyone who's against you

[Gabriel:]

I don't stand a chance
If I were you I'd be standing my own
