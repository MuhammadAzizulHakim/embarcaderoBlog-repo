======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
I'm standing still
I'm lying on the floor
Cause I don't know how to break free

"Cold And Ugly"

â€œThrow that Bob Marley wanna-be motherfucker outta here
Wash her down, wash her down
And he'll burn her down

Nothing is new here underneath this gravelly bed and stained glass
This is old hat and this is new coat and this is the gravelly way
Now she's calling me,
Can you hear me?
The killer in this gravelly bed and stained glass
Oh no no no no no no

It's not too late for me now that I've lost you
It's not too late for me now that you've lost me

And you'll burn my soul to make up for lost time
Blood, sweat and tears is pouring down her glass
Her glass is burning. Love.

And she'll burn you to make up for lost time
Blood, sweat and tears is pouring down her glass
Drifting in this gravelly bed and stained glass

"Hooker With A Penis"

I don't remember what made me say that
I'm getting so high
I can't remember why I said I wanted to
I'm getting along so well with my friends
They call me "the prick"
I think I'm the kind of man they want
They would never know
But I'm just a man
They don't really think much of you

I'm on my own
I don't really know
What I want and what I need
And they may not know it, but they still love me

But I'm just a man
They don't really think much of you

I'm on my own
I don't really know
What I want and what I need
And they may not know it, but they still love me

But I'm just a man
They don't really think much of you

"Jack In The Box"

[Bonus Track]

Hey you, I'm you
Hey you, I'm you

If I open the door
I get a box
That holds all my matters
And a box then
I get a box
And I get a box

I'm on my own
I'm not really sure
What I want and what I need
And they may not know it, but they still love me

But I'm just a man
They don't really think much of you

I'm on my own
I don't really know
What I want and what I need
And they may not know it, but they still love me

But I'm just a man
They don't really think much of you

"Jimmy"

What was it like to see
One of my all time fav.
Now I'm all too proud
To see how they all react
To see me fight
Trying to stand up
While the rest of the world
Slickers to death

Nothing is new here underneath this
Insects hide the truth
People lie in wait
The silence deafens the hearts of the
Horseshoes

Nothing is new here underneath this
Insects hide the truth
People lie in wait
The silence deafens the hearts of the
Horseshoes

But I know when toprepare for any reaction
I'm not afraid to be taken
