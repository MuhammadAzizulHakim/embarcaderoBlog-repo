======================================== SAMPLE 49 ========================================


A sorrow celebration
Enduring one of the most catastrophic events in modern annals

As the night went on
And the silence was broken
By the sound of music

<|endoftext|>

"Disappear"

We made the world believe us
And left you feeling alone
To pretend that you don't exist at all

And then you took my money
And said "now how do you feel?"

The world changed from a freefall into one
The moon shook and turned round
The sky grew darker

I lost my faith in you
Father, be my witness
They walked me through the rain
They told me to go
They took my money and swore that they'd never let me down

Then they took my money and swore it'll stay
And turned around and called me a junkie

"Lipan Conjuring"

It was the first experience
Of knowing someone of her beauty and her dark side

And I knew it was the start of the end

The world changed from a freefall into one
The moon shook and turned round
The sky grew darker
And I lost my faith in you
Father, be my witness
They walked me through the rain
They told me to go
They took my money and swore that they'd never let me down

And then they took my money and swore it'll stay
And turned around and called me a junkie

"Look What You Will"

So glad I can finally say goodbye
I've got a feeling it will stay with me forever

And I can't escape from this pain
It's almost like a dream come true

And I can't escape from this pain
It's almost like a dream come true

I was pretending to be sleeping then I heard footsteps overhead
The sun was burning hot and so I ventured inside

I remember the night perfectly
The night is still burning bright
With the dawning of summer
Never forget

"The Start Of Something Beautiful"

Started it all again
With the past tense here
And with the uneasiness here
We've got the children we barely know
We've got the bills we're overdue
We've got the silence that keeps our hearts racing
And the hope that keeps our dreams alive

"Blackest Eyes"

I am afraid to be happy
I am afraid to be happy
Not only can I not see you
But I don't like this feeling
I don't like the feeling of not knowing you

I am not the same as all of you
But I don't give a shit...

You're finding your voice soeping
through the walls of your mind
That's why you're calling me
Apocalyptic fiction
a nightmare for the eyes
And it's why you're crying
Now it's time to face the facts

I walk the streets of my own city
Every day of the week
It's no concern of mine
I'm too scared to be a part of something beautiful

I painted my nails up for you to see
But you are too cold for that
I've been blinded by your love
For they will be behind me by the night

Walk through the city streets
As I pass the first shadow
It will take all my courage
To stand up and take the next step

Walk through the city streets
As you pass the first shadow
It will take all my courage
To stand up and take the next step

Walk through the city streets
As you pass the first shadow
It will take all my courage
To stand up and take the next step

Walk through the city streets
As you pass the first shadow
It will take all my courage
To stand up and take the next step

Walk through the city streets
As you pass the first shadow
It will take all my courage
To stand up and take the next step

Walk through the city streets
As you pass the first shadow
It will take all my courage
To stand up and take the next step

"CHORUS"

Strapped down our chasm
Tied with our pride
We sustain our appetites
By asking too many stupid or controversial
Frantically arrogant
Toile under the curb

Fatwa from a god but never held public opinion
Same old and false
Same old bad

Same old left

We are sacrificed in vain
Like a blind man in a maze
Wherever we choose to go
We're burned

We are educated but never held a public opinion
Same old and false
Same old
