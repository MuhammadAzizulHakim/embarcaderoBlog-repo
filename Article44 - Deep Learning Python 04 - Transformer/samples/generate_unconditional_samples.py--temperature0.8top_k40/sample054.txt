======================================== SAMPLE 54 ========================================
I'm sorry it took you so far
But I can't help feeling that I deserve it
It's a burden no one should feel
It's a burden no one should fight
It's a burden no one should die

Cold inside my arms
Cold inside my hearts
I'm the same

"Cold And Ugly"

â€œThrow that Bob Marley wanna-be motherfucker outta here
Out of the house, won't you say?
Fret for your pride
And latte a cheque book for your saviour

Sweat on my brow and malaise on my tongue
Tear down those blackened knuckles

Good-bye, blackened knuckles
Good-bye, latte a cheque book for your saviour

You're gonna regret it...
Useless blackened knuckles

The latte is your answer
The cheque book your answer

Don't do that to me
Don't hate me
Don't tell me how sorry I am

You're gonna regret it
Useless blackened knuckles

The latte is your answer
The cheque book your answer

Don't do that to me
Don't hate me
Don't tell me how sorry I am

The cheque book your answer
The cheque book your answer

"Flicker"

Set to a motion picture or a motion picture adaptation
With a thousand lies ahead of me
I'm ahead of the beholder

You're gonna regret it
Useless blackened knuckles

The cheque book your answer
The cheque book your answer

"The Count Of Tuscany"

The Count of Tuscany
Was a eccentric man, best known for his deathbed portrait
But he was a man of letters and of memory

He was beloved by his own people, he called upon his circle of friends
For guidance and consolation, he rode a charlatan

While in foreign lands he traveled with a violent bent
He in turn was a danger to his own people
A man of letters and of memory

I once heard his voice calling for me

Now it seems my love has withered
As the secrets it is seeking

It is the yearning to take possession
It is the yearning to be free

[Sample is the letter "GGG".]

It is the yearning to be free
To be a man of letters and of memory

Nocturnally helpless
From the ashes of failure
Through the embers of victory

Like a cancer scare
Influence already there
Leading to your death

Embracing the truth never found in the store of value

Control and then you're gone
There's nothing left
For the performance artist who made you money

"Behind The Veil"

Some will find us retrograde
Others will embrace the endeavor
Others will down turn

Walk the streets of Los Angeles this morning
Take my money tomorrow
I don't care what you think
There's no guarantee
You're born in the city
You're gonna stumble and fall
But you can't deny me now
You're gonna shine no more

Through the windows of your own living room
The message you leave behind
It's a blank stare
That confines the path you take

Walk the streets of Los Angeles this morning
Take my money tomorrow
I don't care what you think
There's no guarantee
You're born in the city
You're gonna stumble and fall
But you can't deny me now
You're gonna shine no more

Through the windows of your own living room
The message you leave behind
It's a blank stare
That confines the path you take

Walk the streets of Los Angeles this morning
Take my money tomorrow
I don't care what you think
There's no guarantee
You're born in the city
You're gonna stumble and fall

"Undertow"

Two times in.

I've been struck dumb by a voice that
speaks, from deep beneath peerless water that's
