======================================== SAMPLE 17 ========================================
Maybe I...Maybe I...Maybe I should talk to you
Open your eyes
And maybe you'll find that I'm just a
Sleeping Giant
You deceived your own children
With ungrateful fathers
Your time has come

I want to know
What it takes for you to concede
And open my eyes
So that I can see
What it takes for me to concede

[IV. The Slaughter of The Thecores]

Mother Mary quite contrary
Than all reason
Threats from the outside
But upon seeing my daughter she immediately rose up

Undisguised manmade nova
Maggie escapes from the shadows
She can't escape the truth
She's caught a man unaware
She's caught a man who's sick of being told the truth

"Lightbulb Sun"

The first thing that I saw as,
The sun was burning bright.
The second that I seen as,
The sun was sinking further down.

Feeling colder and stranger
I've been wanting to climb higher

I tried the tea tree and watched the leaves move
I tried the black stone and watched the smoke pass

But I'll try when the thirst paralyzing
Then the mountain breeze carries me
And I'll try when the mountain breeze carries me

The mountain breeze carries me
And I'll try when the mountain breeze carries me

"Nine Cats"

The sky is black and the air is thick with clouds
The moon is deep in astray form and all but empty
My mind is astray and all I know is astray

The universe is a living dream and I can't escape it
My body is a furnace of light and I'm bound to feed upon it
I'm the one that will stay inside

When I'm down I drive the hearse

The universe is a living dream and I can't escape it
My body is a furnace of light and I'm bound to feed upon it
I'm the one that will stay inside

When I'm down I drive the hearse

The universe is a living dream and I can't escape it
My body is a furnace of light and I'm bound to feed upon it
I'm the one that will stay inside

When I'm down I drive the hearse

The universe is a living dream and I can't escape it
My body is a furnace of light and I'm bound to feed upon it
I'm the one that will stay inside

When I'm down I drive the hearse

"The Bigger Picture"

Conversation No.
Synopsis
A solitary candle burns in the dark
An inborn need for control leads to despair
As the night goes on

I can see
The path that he has chosen
Leading to his empty grave

Still he sleeps unfulfilled
I watch from the shadows
While the night draws near

Every night he dreams of the night
When he was young
He went wandering through the shadows

Outside where he thought he would never come back
Now alone he sleeps unfulfilled
In the presence of all those who love and fear

Every night he dreams of the night
When he was young
He went wandering through the shadows

Outside where he thought he would never come back
Now alone he sleeps unfulfilled
In the presence of all those who love and fear

"The Bigger Picture"

Long before the colors start to bleed
I can see
The path that he has chosen
Leading to his empty grave

Still he sleeps unfulfilled
I watch from the shadows
While the night draws near

Every night he dreams of the night
When he was young
He went wandering through the shadows

Outside where he thought he would never come back
Now alone he sleeps unfulfilled
In the presence of all those who love and fear

"The Blind House"

If you want to stay
Always here
All these years
The last frontier
It's no concern of theirs
The world outside
Corrupts my child
So trust me

Faith is in your soul
But in the name of God
You must believe
In his love for you
No matter what

Faith is in your soul
But in the name of God
You must love
You as we are

You live here and you die here
You die here, in the name of God

Brother, fear is a burden
But faith is in your soul
But in the name of God
You must love
You as we are

You live
