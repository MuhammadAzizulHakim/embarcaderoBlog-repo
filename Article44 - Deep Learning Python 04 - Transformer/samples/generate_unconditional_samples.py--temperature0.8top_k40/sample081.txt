of the greatest tragedies in human history

Never can a love song fail
In spite of years of anguish
When love is the answer
And the message is clear
Our time is never too far

"A Rite Of Passage"

Since the dawn of time
Men have been searching for it
Treasures left behind
 Forgotten brothers and sisters
Men and women searching for a voice
A rite of passage

Time and space like janes and men
Stars and galaxies circling
Flyards of light giving clues
As stars appear on the map

Passing a moon through the haze
Moonlight sparkling through the mist
The surrounding skies are one
Torn apart by the phenomenon
All are mesmerized
Lured out by the scene

"Omniscient"

If I still had-
If I still hadthe will to believe
In this power and beautyWe possess
There can be no other conclusion
I can imagine why we can't live our lives the way we do

Through a veil of tears we rise-
To carry out this miracle
Through a rite of passage through the haze
Moonlight caressing a dream
Once again she brings the light
into our dreams

"Closure"

Free the flame within
Free the grain of truth
Through rigorous questioning
She finds common ground

Hoping that this testing will help restore us
to face
We're troubled and divided
How can we live our lives this way?

We search for balance
We search for truth
Through rigorous reflection
She makes the impossible a reality

We search for compassion
We search for beauty
Through rigorous prayer
We find truth through rigorous reflection

Praying for absolution
Praying for forgiveness
Praying for eternity

We search for comfort
We search for the peace that we all feel
We search for meaning through our lives
Through rigorous reflection

Shackles of commitment still fell
As we tried to find our words of understanding
We learned that sobriety is not a cure
It's only a matter of time

Proven over time

"Constant Transmission"

Transmitance

As I peer into the abyss
Past and present
I am constantly shifting
Transmitting thoughts and feelings

Transmitting energy
Transmitting light
Transmitting truth

Transmitting time

Transmitting thoughts
Transmitting pain
Transmitting awareness

54° Latching
(Being inside the mind)
53° Swimming
(We are swimming)
52° Returning
(back to shore)
51° Swimming
(We are returning)
50° Returning

Transmitting energy
Transmitting truth

Transmitting time

"Beneath The Surface"

Is there ever really been a time?
No, really ever was a time
No, really ever was a time
No, really ever was a time
No, really ever was a time
No
I can remember when the last time
I tried was five years or something
It was so hard to get over
Even though I'm not sure I like the way
It's so hard to get over

You know the truth, the weak link,
You get to choose
If you want to get back to life, you have to be

It's not too late for me, not too late for you
Because I believe that even when things go wrong
They can't always be ignored
And I can't wait to fix things that have gone wrong
Until then I will be your life
And I will give you what you need
Forget about what you're used to
Because there's so much more I can do

I can remember when the last time
I tried was five years
No, really ever was a time
No, really ever was a time
No, really ever was a time
No, really ever was a time
No
I can remember when the last time
I tried was five years
No, really ever was a time
No, really ever was a time
No, really ever was a time
No

"Disappear"

We made the world believe we didn't care
And painted it all over our walls

We covered our deafening waves with blue sky
With a halo of sweat and tears

And left behind
A sense of loss
Like thericanes who've wiped us out
And left us helpless
We rode out the storm
With the familiar silhouette of a new high

We laughed about it, hated it,
But it didn't take
