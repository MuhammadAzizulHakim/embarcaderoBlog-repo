======================================== SAMPLE 62 ========================================
O you whose will be done?

You're bleeding for no one
And nowhere is your peace of mind when you're falling.
Ooooh and it always burns in your chest
So try to ignore the pain and the doubt
Ooooh and it always burns in your chest

And this is no laughing matter
You're tearing at your skin
And this is no one's day plumcy
Ooooh and it always burns in your chest
Ooooh and it always burns in your chest

Oooooh oooh

You're breathing soooo good
You're shedding soooo many colors
And this is no one's day plumcy
Ooooh and it always burns in your chest

So try to ignore the pain and the doubt
Oooooh ooh

And this is no laughing matter
You're breathing soooo good
You're shedding soooo many colors
And this is no one's day plumcy
Oooooh and it always burns in your chest

Oooooh ohooo

Monica, daddy, is there something I want to say?
Mom, there's no-one left to take my son to
High.
I don't know when I'll let this bring me home,
And if someone will come to mean something,
It'll be church or something.

It's not OK, son
It's not OK, mom

"Father's Lament"

[also known as "The Seventh Sojourn" or "The Forest for the Teeth"]:

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
The chill that's haunting my dreams,
The final sigh calls to me,
Rip your hands off my chest,
And set me free.

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
The chill that's haunting my dreams,
The last sigh calls to me,
Rip your hands off my chest,
And set me free.

"Historia de la Muertes"

The Seventh sojourn
Spurs the way
Futile hand and mind
Leave behind
Spouse and children
Nothing to fear, oh oh

The forest for the teeth
Dreams are long since over
And still life is scarred by death
Never again to feel the rain

Unchain the colours before my eyes
The chill that's haunting my dreams,
The final sighs call to me,
Rip your hands off my chest,
And set me free.

"The Seventh Sojourn"

(The Seventh Sojourn)

Out in the far off reaches of space
Meet the people and the sights
There's something in the guts of your heart
That pushes you to the edge of insanity
And leaves you hanging.

Into the dark recesses of the night
Look through the projection,
Beyond the pale moonlight.
Exile is all you seek
Look into the eyes of death.

Look into the eyes of death

"Terror In The Soul"

[from "The Glass Prison", from "The Seventh Sojourn"]

So there I was
In the concrete meadow, unearthly scream
Ogres fed on the chaos of time
Went back to my wagon
Bonemold of Havoc
Cowboys and princesses
Old ways and learned from mistakes
Got together with angels to make a paradise
And there it was
I could keep away from ghosts
The most perfect man in the land

I made amends with Satan
And Martyrs with the believers
I gave them wings
And teared them up
I gave them up
As I would wish for nothing more

And there I was
In the concrete meadow, unearthly scream
Ogres fed on the chaos of time
Went back to my wagon
Bonemold of Havoc
Cowboys and princesses
Old ways and learned from mistakes
Got together with angels to make a paradise
And there it was
I could keep away from ghosts
The most perfect man in the land
I'm afraid to say that I am
The one, The Seventh Sojourn

I felt the weight on my shoulders
I charged forward with a purpose
To carry on
The apostle in me
