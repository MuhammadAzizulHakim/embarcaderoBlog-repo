======================================== SAMPLE 97 ========================================
Trapped inside a nightmare
The stars above aligned
The sky was clear and frigid
Rain lashed down on darkened stone
The only light at night was the discordant heartbeat of the night

I cannot remember happiness
I thrive within the dark
The night makes me feel sad

Even when I'm in the quarterfinals
There's a certain dishonor
That dulls the pleasure
I feel like I'm walking out of hell

"Space-Dye Vest"

Falling through pages of Martens on angels
Wearing Vest of the Millennium
Feeling my heart pull west
I was the second to last
The sun rose up on darkened stone
The blood would flow to the stars
Only me and my life

By the way, I'm doing fine
I've got a place to stay, just behind the sunshine
And by the way, I'm doing fine I'm planning to return

And I can see you
Running into my ghost on the planet
I thought you could come tell me of all things good
You saved my life there too
I thought you could send me back, but now I'm too scared to ask

For a moment I thought I knew you
Tried to save your life there
But there's something in the way
I feel like I'm walking through hell

"The Great Debate"

[also known as "Conflict At Ground Zero"]
[music by Myung, Petrucci, Portnoy, Rudess]
[lyrics by John Petrucci]

"A gallop snapshot poll taken immediately after President Bush's speach on
funding embryonic stem cell research last night shows that half of Americans
approve of his decision, 25% do not, and still another 25% are not sure what
to think."

"Most people don't even know what stem cells are."

"Who is going to scream the loudest?"

"No one is talking to them. They're all thinking about it. And it's not just about me.
It's not just about you. It's not just about you. It's not just about you. It's not just about me. It's not just about Jupiter. It's not just about Venus. It's not just about life."

"I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm. All alone.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm. All alone.
All that I want to be is you. I want you to be the person I am meant to be. I want you to be the reason I am here. I want you to know I'm not here. I want you to know I'm not here. I don't want you to know..."

"The best thing that I ever did was I lay my hand upon a girl's face.
You know what I mean?"

"God damn regrets!"

"I wish I could embrace you and make you proud...
But I don't think that's what we all do."

"Do I admire people who I admire just waiting for some kind of revelation? Of course not.
Yes I would. I'd wish you luck. I wish you luck. I wish you luck.

And still she sleeps with her father [7x]

He's my life, she's my life, he's my life, she's my life [8x]

And she's scared of daddy's love
And she's scared of her own fear
And she's scared of her own father's love

I'm here, I'm here, I'm here [9x]

And she's scared to death of fear
And she's scared to lose of her son
And she's scared to be taken by surprise

And she's done

With the world on our side
and she's doing
Nothing is wrong with me
I'm innocent until proven guilty
And I'm innocent until proven guilty

I want what I have and nothing is left
I want what I have and nothing is left

Cold guessing the future
Obsession's not helping me feel
My mind's eye on the prize
I'm drawn up against the wall
It forces me to my knees
I turn to the light
Winding through the final pages

Nothing helps me feel this
Nothing seems to bring me back

Watching myself in a forest of flesh
I'm drawn up against a wall
Nothing helps me to break out

Searching out my next adventure
I'm drawing down the line
I'm drawing up the line
I'm drawing down the line

If I die tomorrow
I fade into the darkness
Nothing changes but hope

Nothing helps me feel
