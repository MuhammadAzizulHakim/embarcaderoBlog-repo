======================================== SAMPLE 71 ========================================
This is the moment
The end of an era

Destined to be a god
Embrace our common fate
Born the travesty of man
Regular pulse on our part
Blew the light of discovery
Flushed the light of revolution

Our moment in the sun
Our moment in the sun
Our moment in the sun
Our moment in the sun
Our moment in the sun
Our moment in the sun

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What if the rest of the world
Wash your hands of regret
Cleanse and purge
In liquid form
Before swallowing your poison

IDS PLEASE
Don't stop breathing
You must first get out
And then stay alive

Life is short, so learn from your mistakes
And after all the people
I've missed
I'll feel safe knowing that I didn't die out there

There was no love lost
No, there was no love lost
For all of you who have died
There was no forgiveness
No, there was no forgiveness
For all of you who have died
There was no forgiveness
No, there was no forgiveness
For all of you who have died

"There Will be Others"

There will be no forgiveness
Forfeit all you have
Forfeit all you only once you're gone

You're forgiven with each loss
You're righteous with each victory
You're all set free

There will be no peace
Out of anger and spite
There will be no salvation
Forfeit all you take
Forfeit all you have
Forfeit all you have once you're gone

And there will be no forgiveness
Forfeit all you take
And leave you alone

There will be no salvation
Forfeit all you take
And leave you alone

"Disappear"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]
As you know I am the father of X
And I will be the first one
To stand
Before you in naked anger
Before you are defenseless
Before you are broken by anger
Before you can come clean
Before you can face the blame

There will be no forgiveness
Forfeit all you've done
Forfeit all you've lost
There will be no salvation
Forfeit all you've lost

"The Moor"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Faythe:]
Under the disguise of a friend
He is a stranger to me
Yet he is beloved by me

Beyond the fog of war
I've seen the true face of our shared dream

In the distant past
We came to honor our shared dream
Weathered through the storms of war
Through the sacred rites of stonemasonry

Though we are brought up unaware
Amidst the violence of love
Yet we are kept sane through fierce conflict
Through the worship of secrecy

Though we are brought up unaware
Amidst the violence of love
Yet we are kept sane through fierce conflict
Through the worship of secrecy

"The Enemy Inside"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night]

[Arhys:]
On the road to revolution
We came to honor our shared dream
Our eyes have seen the light
Yet on the bright side
It has meant nothing
As the night has gone on
I keep coming home

I know that I am not the same as you
I know that I am not alone
I know that I am ready to share this revolution
With anyone who will listen

I know that I am considered a par
Yet all I feel is admiration
All I feel is disdain
All I despise is confidence
Ignorant and stubborn
Leading to our demise

Behind the palace walls
There is a belief system
There is a freedom of thought and expression
Across the empire

I know that I am regarded as a god among heartened soldiers
I know that I am considered a par
Yet all I feel is admiration
All I feel is disdain
