But it's not so bad
I'm pretty sure I know what I'm talking
alcohol is a lie
Cold feet are a problem
Never seem to get away from this
So I'll never walk again
Trust me on this one
You're gonna regret it

This obsession
Will never get away from here
It's all but gone away
It's all but gone away

Don't call me selfish
Faint smile staring back
I'm calling you out on the aaa and whatnot
What's left is gonna be just what you thought it would be
Deception at its finest

"Stars Die"

The moon shook and curled up like gentle fire
The ocean glazed and melted wire
Voices buzzed in spiral eyes
Stars dived in blinding skies

Stars die. Blinding skies.

Tree cracked and mountain cried
Bridges broke and window sighed
Cells grew up and rivers burst
Sound obscured and sense reversed

Stars die. Blinding skies.

[Spoken:]
Hello, Neil and Buzz.
I´m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made from the White House.
I just can´t tell you how proud we all are of what you have done.
For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives.
Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man´s world.
And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.

Idle mind and severed soul
Silent nerves and begging bowl
Shallow haze to blast away
Hyper sleep to end the day

Stars die. Blinding skies.

"Dislocated Day"

A dislocated day
Peers in to the ether
Counts the stars inside the sky
And flies in to the never

Looped around my eyelids
A thousand shining flecks
Pale against the canvas
Which hangs around my neck

Dislocated day
I will find a way
To make you say
The name of your forgiver

Stood beside an inlet
A starfish leads a dance
It dreams it is a human
And falls into a trance

A hole inside my body
Is wired up to a charge
Chemical imbalance
Tells me who you are

Insects hide the silence
November brings deep rain
Between the flow to freezing
And yesterday's sustain

"The Wind R Us Up"

Unwind it with me
To fall back again

Let it roll off my chest
Don't be afraid to be alone
The pain is real
The bite that brought me here
To make you say...
The name of your forgiver

Stood beside an inlet
A starfish leads a dance
It dreams it is a human
And falls into a trance

A hole inside my body
Is wired up to a charge
Chemical imbalance
Tells me who you are

Insects hide the silence
November brings deep rain
Between the flow to freezing
And yesterday's sustain

"Trains"

Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And here he is
Behind the window I wish
The face of destiny in doubt

"Baby Dream In Cellophane"

I am looking for a voice inside my head
I am looking for a girl who thinks she can change
I am looking for a girl who thinks she can change and why

I want to be loved
I want to be respected
I want to be liked

I want to be respected
I want to be loved

I want to be loved
I want to be respected
I want to be respected
I want to be loved

I want to be loved
I want to be respected
I want to be loved

I want to be respected
I want to be loved
