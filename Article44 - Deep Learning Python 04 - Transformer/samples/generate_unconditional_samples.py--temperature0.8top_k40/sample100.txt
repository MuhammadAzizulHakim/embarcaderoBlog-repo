The ultimate test of faith
I waited in the
branchless moonlight
Where lonely angels played
Over the rose and the devotional

I awaited the day when she would give me her
mail

"When We Trust In You"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Faythe:]

Faythe, you are my ally
he knows the truth
Of who we are
and where we are
When we trust in you
We are one
When we trust in you
We are all one

When we trust in you
We are just one
When we trust in you
We are all one

And I can't live up
I can't let you down

I can't let you down
I need you more than you need me
And I can't live up
I can't let you down
I need you more than you need me
And I can't live up
I can't let you down
I need you more than you need me

[Arabelle:]

Fate found a way
To bring them together
And light a fuse
When we both know
Who we are
And where we are

Without you I can't survive
I can't let you down
I can't let you down

"Sorceress 2"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night]

[Daryus:]

She's only 21
But still she brings wealth and power
By forging a name for herself
X her wealth and X power

She is not content with this life
She has to stretch beyond her physical limits
By marrying the man who has educated her
She has to travel far to find her

She is not content with this life
She has to travel far to find her

She is not content with this life
She has to sacrifice her independence
For the man who has educated her

For every child she brings
She will not want another
She is ready to take on the burden
She is ready to leave her mark

If she obeyed all the directions
And kept her mouth shut all night
Then she would be ready to move into her own home

[Arabelle:]

Her story is one that I am ready to share
She has just arrived home from a royal wedding
The evening stars shine brightly
And Arhys and X will surely be royal guests

If she followed all the simple steps
Then she would be set free

She is ready to take on the burden
She is ready to move into her own home

[Daryus:]

If she followed all the simple steps
Then she would be set free

And she's gonna want everyone raptured
She's gonna want them both scared
She's gonna want them both scared

And when will we all have fun?

You're gonna rot in a fit of rage
You're gonna be all alone

Oh what the hell...
This city's too loud!

Come with me, drizzle!
Don't leave your bags!

You're gonna regret this!
What did you think of my gift?
What did you think of my gift?
