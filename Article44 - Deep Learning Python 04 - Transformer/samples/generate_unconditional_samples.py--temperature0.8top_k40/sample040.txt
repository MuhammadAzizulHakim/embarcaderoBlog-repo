======================================== SAMPLE 40 ========================================
You promised me
You prayed for me
And we've been together all this time
But nothing's happened
And you and I
Can't go back together
Because of who we are

I walked away
But with you in my life
I know you're not gone
Only a scarred and bruised me
Will never rest
My soul will tremble with the loss

Living life is no more
It's better to be cut down than cut down in love
There is nothing sacred
Only saints endure

I walk the streets alone
And take the lead
In a voice that thunders
I'll need your help
To fix my life

"Lightbulb Sun"

The sun is a light bulb
A candle's a treat
The curtains stay closed now
On my little retreat
Or in a forest of its own

I spend all my days contemplating
The decline and its aftermath
Though I may have saved them all

Sunlight affliction
A candle's a treat
The mist for the eyes
Deficiency at heart
A heart attack a burden never felt

I spend all my days contemplating
The decline and its aftermath
Though I may have saved them all

But in the end it's none of my doing

To waste another moment
To arrive at my conclusion
To find out what has really been
A waste of time

I spent all my days contemplating
The decline and its aftermath
Though I may have saved them all

But in the end it's none of my doing

To waste another moment
To arrive at my conclusion
To find what has really been
A waste of time

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to help you down
Help yourself brother
You lie and smile daily
But never enough
Forget about yourself
Forget about yourself
And leave

When I feel like I'm sinking
I'm pouring myself soon
I'm reaching for the light
When in doubt are necessary
I'm never enough

I feel like I'm sinking
Still I burn when I feel like I'm sinking

"Illumination Theory"

[additional notes below the tracklist]

Blackness consumes
And deceives the mind
In the beginning darkness was your only escape
As I draw near the drawn breath escapes
You close the gap
As I breathe in
You close the gap
As I draw near the drawn breath escapes

Now I'm drawing near
And I'm drawing near
And I'm drawing near
And I draw near
It's not long yet
But I'll draw near
And I'll draw near

You can't completely erase the wreckage
You can only react as you desire
And when necessary act upon what you see
And when necessary act upon what you do

Now I'm drawing near
And I'm drawing near
And I draw near
And I draw near
You can't completely erase the wreckage
You can only react as you desire
And when necessary act upon what you see
And when necessary act upon what you do

"Bleak"

Beating
Heart still beating for the cause
Feeding
Heart still beating for the cause
Crawling
To safety
One last time
Before losing all hope
Before turning back away
I must hide
My presence from the world
So that I may face the end
Before I depart this place

Blown away
From love
Stole from love

All my matters
So many years have passed
Since I last saw you
My love for you
Wishing you all the days of your life
Is stronger than all your wars

I will give you what you need
Nothing more to worry about
Just take what I have for you
And bear with me forever

Bear with me now
Never stop the drive
Just go and find the strength
To carry on
This way or the other
Just take what is left
With or without you

Blowed away
From love
Stole from love
From love
Stole from love
From love

"Over There"

Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
And I can still see you running
Through the streets of my own fabled paradise

knew it from the looks of it
You were meant for this world
Beyond the shadows of our lives

But in the deafness of your silence, I could not hear you
There was no desire to speak
No self loathing
No deep prejudice
