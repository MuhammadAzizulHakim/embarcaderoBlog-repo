"The Alien"

Look beyond the Earth, heading set for the stars
Interplanetary, some are near, some are far
Terraform a new world, survival for mankind
Options but a few, we are running out of time

Should you climb aboard
A voyage, the first of its kind
Ready to explore
All that you've known left behind

Our Holy Grail
Now redefined
Our purpose, a thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand
Life beyond here, digital man

Alien, changed forever
New found world in the stars

Understand the meaning
Certain we'll extend the scale of consciousness
Woman, child and man
Multi planet species out amongst the stars
Not stuck in and around who and what we are

Time to climb aboard
Countdown to takeoff on time
Systems are online (5, 4, 3, 2)
Farewell to all humankind (1)

Our Holy Grail
Clearly defined
Our purpose, a thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand
Life beyond here
Digital man

Alien, changed forever
New found world, here we are

Our Holy Grail
Clearly defined
Our purpose a thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand

Our Holy Grail
Read between the lines
One purpose, one thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand

I am the alien
Out here in the stars
We'll search 'til we find
No matter how far
A far better world
For all human race
And beyond

"Answering the Call"

White walls, glisten
Empires, crimson
Aching within
Raging fire

Sovereign, asphyxiate
No conscience
A solemn state
Misguide, indoctrinate
Accepted long held views

When will there be a day when all of us
Trust in love and peace?
Burns bright for us
When will the long-held truth be cast aside?
Embrace our fellow man, no longer vilified

Radiant we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Illuminating all
Answering the call

Decisions by which to act
Programmed, no turning back
Call upon a switch turned on
An ultimate price to pay

Weeping mother too late to cry
Hold the truth, can't ignore the lie
Time to look it in the eye

When will there be a day when all of us
Trust and know in love and peace
When will the long held truth be cast aside
Embrace our fellow man, no longer vilified

Radiant we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Illuminating all
Answering the call

Fight or flight, both threatening
Hidden thoughts are deafening
Your guilt feeding the flame
Tearful knowing it's a lie
Desired might just past you by
Rituals your funeral pyre

Scars you can't erase
If you choose to face
There is beauty in us all
Walk the higher ground
There you will be found
The writing's on the wall
Will you wager your life?

Radiant we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Walk the higher ground
There you will be found
Illuminating all
Answering the call
Answering the call

"Invisible Monster"

When you face the creature
That waits beneath your bed
Will you stare into its eyes or look away?

Running toward the fire
Or fleeing from the flame
The choice to seek or hide is yours to make

The serpent inside
Wrapping its tail around my neck
I'm buried alive
Dying to take another breath

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave
Invisible monster

Hiding, never showing its face
Feeding on irrational fear
Thoughts race at a feverish pace
Soaring on a flight of ideas

Perched on its victim's shoulder
Whispering in its ear
Things that may never happen
Worries too much to bear

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave
Invisible monster

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave

Invisible monster
Beast that dwells inside my mind
Give up your hold let me take back control
Invisible monster
Invisible monster

"Sleeping Giant"

Some will be driven by conflict
Others will fight the good fight
Some will rely on the darkness
Some will rely on the light
Some elevate with compassion
Yearning for knowledge and peace
Some motivate through aggression
Selfishly serve their own needs

Shadows disappear at night
Buried out of fear
Driven underground
Hidden lies the rage inside
Like a ticking bomb
That doesn't make a sound

People will obsess
With suffering and death
Questioning their own desires
This morbid fascination
Renders us possessed
By our violent and destructive side

When we lay our armor down
Fragments of our love
Slip through the cracks of hate
But the raging storm below
Will never go away
If it is not embraced

Shadows disappear at night
Buried out of fear
Driven underground
Hidden lies the rage inside
Like a ticking bomb
That doesn't make a sound

Shadows disappear at night
Harmless as a dove
Clever like a snake
Hidden lies the rage inside
Like sleeping giant
One we dare not wake

Standing under the eclipse
Are we sheltered and concealed
Or bathing in its glow?

Our desires and ambitions
And our need to believe
There is good in this world
Spin a common thread

<|endoftext|>

"Transcending Time"

Drifting in a far off place
I roam the countryside
Seeking wings of thought
Waiting in the blind

Enchanted and transfixed
I am pulled into the still
By a backward ticking clock
Held against my will

Illusions turn to dust
Scatter to the wind
Like dreaming while awake

Signals in the mist
Altered state of mind
Stars in the abyss
Transcending time

Midnight in the garden
Digging for a spark
Where seeds of inspiration
Lie buried in the dark

Attention starts to wonder
As the poet lifts his pen
And the critic from within
Is silenced once again

Limits leave no trace
Ashes in the rain
Lost and far away

Signals in the mist
Altered state of mind
Stars in the abyss
Transcending time

Signals in the mist
Stars in the abyss

Euphoric obsession
Without conscious intention
Being pulled by the current
On a vessel steered by someone else

Transcending time
Transcending time
Transcending time
Transcending time

"Awaken the Master"

Finding your way
On a frozen path where the air is thin
The angel of balance
Keeps you alive

A flower unfolds
A heartbeat brings new meaning to the universe
The angel of balance
Keeps you strong
Discovering what has been all along

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light
Remember hereafter

You made it to the top
Just to find out
You're only halfway there
All along missing the point of the journey

The will of the soul
Like a peak so high
You look inside to rise
Searching out a dream
Climbing, reaching further
And the voices of the angels bring you closer

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light
Remember hereafter

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light

Spinning through
We balance the heart and the mind

Turning the stone
Embracing the truth that we find

Remember hereafter
The end of a chapter
Awaken the master
Awaken the master

"A View from the Top of the World"

[I. The Crowning Glory]

The fire that burns within us
To carry out a dream
Chasing new ambitions
Determined to succeed
To stretch beyond our limits
To blaze a brand new trail
Bold enough to conquer
Brave enough to fail

Sheer determination
Taking nerves of steel
Always digging deeper
Danger all too real

To rise above the challenge
To push to the extreme
To the daring, there can be no in between

See a view from the top of the world
Take a ride on the crest of a wave
The adrenaline rush over and over again
See a view from the top of the world

All my natural instincts
Are begging me to stop
But somehow I carry on
Heading for the top
A physical absurdity
A tremendous mental game
Helping me understand
Exactly who I am

To face a new adventure
To conquer the insane
Lured into madness
Addicted to the pain
Reaching for the summit
On the threshold of defeat
Rightfully joining
The ranks of the elite

See a view from the top of the world
Feel the wind on the edge of the sky
Take a chance you may die, over and over again
See a view from the top of the world

[II. Rapture of the Deep]

I begin the blind ascent
To a place no one has seen
Returning to the womb
On the fringe of the unknown
A journey into darkness beckons me

Like a blind man in a maze
Who somehow finds an open door
The beauty and the danger
And the yearning to explore
Always keeps me coming back for more

[III. The Driving Force]

The moment that you recognize
Just where your limits lie
Hanging on the brink of death
You're never more alive
When you reach the pinnacle
The world is at your feet
Welcome to the mind unleashed
The impossible is never out of reach
When barriers are broken, greatness is achieved
Self belief will build a life of legacy

<|endoftext|>

"Untethered Angel"

You've built this world around you
Your universe
In spite of best intentions
Things could not be worse
Chaos and fear have left you
Hanging by a thread
As you argue with the voice inside your head

Untethered angel
Falling to darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself will set you free

Misgiving and dismay
Nightmares and wasted days
Can't live your life this way
Something needs to change
Cold feet and second thoughts
Entangled, tied in knots
Avoidance at all costs
A painful thing to watch

Fear can live inside you
Push you to the edge
Face the fear within you
Wake up from the dead

Untethered angel
Falling to darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself will set you free
Set you free

Untethered angel
Falling to darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Open your heart
Be set free

<|endoftext|>

"Paralyzed"

The anger, the pressure
You're choking down your words again
Feel the nerves set in
Unspoken frustration
They see right through you
Paper thin
Like the ghost within

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed

The stare of a stranger
Is like a wound that bleeds again
Silent as the dead
The victim
The martyr
Like Daniel in the Lion's Den
Time and time again

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Relentless mental drain
What do you stand to gain?

Viewing life through such a narrow fractured lens
Will ensure you end up on the losing end

Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed

"Fall Into The Light"

Written on the water
Memories dissipate
Eyes begin to open
Darkness drifts away

Time and space like roses
Whose petals drop and fade
And fall into the light
As if dreams of yesterday

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see

There is nothing sacred
Only heaven knows
So turn towards the sun
And look into your soul

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see
Too much hope will never be enough
It's become so clear to me

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see
Too much hope will never be enough
The truth is clear to me

"Barstool Warrior"

In a dark and lonely corner
Of a time-worn dockside inn
Sits a local barstool warrior
Talking to his gin
Tracing past decisions

He motions for a shot
Is he doomed to be a man this world forgot?
Just a prisoner of the monster on his back

Call it bad luck
Call it fate
Call it stuck here the rest of my days
Serves me right
What went wrong?
And where do I belong?

In the glow of flashing lights
On the shoulder of the road
Clutching at the bruises on her skin
She tries to signal danger
With anguish in her eyes
Will he see the world of pain she’s in
Or is it too late?

Was it bad luck?
Was it fate?
Or a past that she couldn't escape?
It's not right
Something's wrong
Just where do I belong?

Promises made
Crying in vain
All empty
Never accepting the blame
And not letting go of the shame
A river of tears
As months turn to years
All wasted
On someone not willing to change
Now only a shadow remains
No one can save you

And there's no one to save
It has been written
You will become all you think,
All you feel, all you dream

Now I'm cutting the anchor away
And I won't look back
I'm starting a new life today
Now I see where I belong

"Room 137"

Someone
Someone is trying
To tell him something
Will he listen?
Should he listen?

Someone
Someone is dying
To find out something
Will he reason?
What is the reason?

Do you see it, there on the door?
Death is coming
Life nevermore
Obsession drives me
Clouding my mind
What's the message?
Am I running out of time?

Someone
Someone is trying
In search of something
Death by numbers
Getting closer

Someone
Someone is dying
To know the answer
The key to heaven
137

Do you see it there on the door?
Death is coming
Life nevermore
Obsession drives me
Clouding my mind
What's the message?
Am I running out of time?

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line
Hidden by design

I can see it here on the door
One-three-seven forevermore
Between dimensions
The boundary line
One-three-seven
I am running out of time

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line
Let me see before I die

"S2N"

Are we paying attention?
Or are we drifting?
Too much negative action
Not enough positive reaction

What's the state of humanity?
Where's the peace and the harmony?
Free the signal, your inner voice
Time to transcend block out the noise

Signal to noise
Becomes the answer
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel

Have you heard the news?
A surging sea of circumstance
Pain, starvation, war, abuse
Sterile gloves hide dirty hands

Shocking truth
Climate change
Floods and fires
Hurricanes
Overdose
Suicide
Innocent die
Fear and race
Endless lies
Sex and faith
Terrorize
Drugs and guns
Taking lives
Innocent die

Signal to noise
Becomes the answer
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel
Signal to noise
Defines the reason
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel
Our wounds begin to heal

Signal to noise
Becomes the answer
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel

As we latch on to the wheel

The chatter disappears
And the message is revealed

"At Wit's End"

Let me help you
How much longer until you realize?
You're getting worse
It's killing you inside
I can't break through
Feel you have to face this on your own
Want to be left alone

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Come alive

You feel I'm asking too much of you
But can't let go
Fear breeds the hate and your apathy
Empty and hollow
You lost your faith
There's no getting through
Why shut me out?
Frantic, disturbed, filled with misery
Can't figure it out

Sleepless, worse for wear
Staring at the ceiling
Numb
Sedated
Intoxicated

Deafening, deafening
Shut it out, shut it out
Burning, burning
No way out, no way out

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Come alive

Asked me to listen
Can't go on and face another day
I lied, not admitting
What I lost is still in you
Something's missing
You see darkness in my eyes
Maculate

There is no cure
Playing over, stop pretending
Warped inside its never-ending tide

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now

"Out Of Reach"

There's something about this girl
Some kind of magic
Swear she cast a spell on me

Not the first time
Might be the last
Can't let this moment slip away
Try to find the words
None sit right with me
Air of confidence
But I can barely breathe

She's without a care
Electrified and held there
A thousand volts igniting me
Her waves crash over me
Far below, out of reach
The undertow, my reverie

Sadness in her smile
Love, it's been a while
Near but far away
She chases it each day
A promise to come back
All the while still waiting
Seems it lost its way

Out of reach
Just too hard to reach
You're letting your life slip away
Out of reach
Yeah it's hard to reach
There's another day
Although you're hurting and afraid
You're stronger than yesterday

<|endoftext|>

"Pale Blue Dot"

So far away from home
Beyond a distant reach
Faint whispers from the edge
Returning piece by piece
A lonely point of light
Captured in a final glance
A solitary hint of life
Discovered if by chance

God creators
Dream destroyers
Spineless cowards and fearless warriors
Hopeful children
Mothers and fathers
Our blood-filled rivers fueled by hate
We worship heroes, kings and saints
But who's out there to save us from ourselves?

All you will ever know
All life that ever was
All you despise or love
Living out their lives
This isolated speck
Hurtling through the cosmic dark
Would seem to go astray
If we were washed away

God creators
Dream destroyers
Knowledge seekers and bold explorers
Hopeful children, mothers and fathers

All on this place we call our home
Adrift in space we're on our own
But who's out there
To save us from ourselves?

"Viper King"

Venomous
By design
Lying idle
Biding time

Bore down the clutch
Tore up the road
Six hundred horses
Genetic code

Lightning speed
The road she bends
Slam down the brakes
Losing my ass end

Drive on
Pushed to the limit
My viper king
We're flying high

Drive on
Filled with desire
Nothing to fear
I feel alive

My viper king

Speed demon
Tempting fate
Do or die
In the blink of an eye

Drive on
Pushed to the limit
My viper king
We're flying high

Drive on
Filled with desire
Nothing to fear
I feel alive

Pushed to the limit

"The Gift Of Music"

[EXT. Ravenskill Town Square - Day]

[Narrator:]
Far in the distant future
Beyond the pages of our time
Cold-blooded wicked tyrants
Threaten the freedom of mankind

Corruption, lust and greed
Define the new nobility
Changing the course of history

Across the vast North Empire
Most people struggle to survive
Living a meek existence
While their secluded leader thrives

[Arhys:]
We are living day to day
Forced to bear the lion's share
People just don't have the time for music anymore
And no one seems to care

My friends I've seen the chosen one
Our quest for freedom has begun
He will be the answer to our prayers

There walks a god among us
Who's seen the writing on the wall
He is the revolution
He'll be the one to save us all

My brother Gabriel is all the hope we need
Shining like a beacon in the night
Shepherd of Ravenskill
A reason to believe

Music is the gift he brings
The songbird stops to listen when he sings

"The Answer"

[EXT. Ravenskill Park - Day]

[Gabriel:]
I don't pretend to have the answer
Never said I held the key
But somehow they see a light inside of me
Am I not the man who I was meant to be?

As the people gather round me
I never felt so all alone
Is this the chance to be someone?
My moment in the sun
Why am I afraid of facing the unknown?

They are finding faith in me and they believe I'm the one to set them free

"A Better Life"

[INT. Ravenskill Rebel Command - Night]

[Arhys:]
As fearless leader of the Ravenskill militia
The blood of warriors
Flows throughout my veins

My brother's gift remains my secret ammunition
It is our hope, our pride
A catalyst for change

Still the fires of revolution burn within my eyes
On this perilous road to freedom
He's our one and only guide

For many years I've seen our people starve and suffer
How many more will die
Before we stand and fight

They ask me Arhys,
"Could things be any tougher?"
The answer's no surprise,
"Yes, you bet your life!"

Now the fires of revolution won't burn for evermore
I see liberty in our future
And it's one worth fighting for

We all long for a better life
Like a dream that can't be denied

This is the moment
Now is the time
Freedom if we live or if we die

I shall give him a better life
I swore this vow to my dying wife
Sure she would not survive

Peacefully
She slipped away
The meaning in my life
Was born that day

And so I found the strength to carry on
With this crusade
It is my fate

Evangeline
You lived a life of misery and pain
Evangeline
I'll never let your memory die in vain

Evangeline
My heavy heart still bleeds
I dedicate my life to set him free
And I will carry on to plant the seeds
I promise in the name of our new son
This battle won't be over until it's won

"Lord Nafaryus"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Narrator:]
How the rumors are spreading like vines
Of a man who has been glorified
News finds its way
To the empire one day
Where the envious ruler resides

[Nafaryus:]
Should I fall for the stories I hear?
Is he really a threat I should fear?
Such a foolish young man
Doesn't seem to understand
So let me be perfectly clear

He may have them inspired
Eating out of his hand
But he'll never be ruler of this land

For myself I must see
What the hype is about
I admit I'm intrigued

I've heard the whispering of revolution
I know the aim of your plan
You think insurgency is your solution
And put your faith in one man

[Narrator:]
His decision is made
So his journey begins
Off to the edge of The Realm
To meet the savior

In the coming days
They'll announce his grace
And he'll ask to be amazed

As a symbol of power and might
It will make for a breathtaking sight
In a massive display
With his family and guards by his side

[Nafaryus:]
Arabelle who means the world to me
Our loyal son, my heir, your future king
And Faythe I treasure more than all the diamonds in my crown
It isn't hard to see
I couldn't be more proud

Into the far off reaches of the land
To witness this great spectacle first hand
Is Gabriel the God he claims to be?
I guess we'll see
Yes we shall see

"A Savior In The Square"

[EXT. Ravenskill Town Square - Day]

[Nafaryus:]

We have come to hear him sing
To see this gift your savior brings

[Narrator:]

A crowd has grown
And all are mesmerized
But silence quickly falls
As Lord Nafaryus arrives

[Nafaryus:]

Please don't stop on my account
Show us what we've heard so much about

[Arhys:]

In peace
We gather here today

[Daryus:]

Don't make him ask again
Do as my father says

[Gabriel:]

Brother, worry not today
I will share my music
And they will soon be on their way
They only know the noise machines
So I'll treat them all to sonic ecstasy

Never in my dreams could I deserve
To ever see a vision quite like her
Then unexpectedly
I'm taken by surprise
An angel just appeared before my eyes

And you're looking toward the light
All that really matters
Is what you leave behind

So let your heart be free
Keep your spirit burning bright
Set down the stones you carry
Take the weight off your mind

When you're facing the path that divides
Know that I will be there by your side
Find your strength in the sound of my voice
And you'll know
Which choice is right

In this fleeting life
We can sometimes lose our way
But night is always darkest
Just before the new day

When you're facing the path that divides
Know that I will be there by your side
Find your strength in the sound of my voice
And you'll know which choice is right

[Faythe:]

This very moment
Was always meant to be
I never noticed
But all at once I see

On the worst of days when I felt most alone
With no one to share the secret that I hide
I grew numb to all the emptiness inside
But now I've found my home

"Act Of Faythe"

[EXT. Ravenskill Town Square - Day]

[Faythe:]

I never knew they spent their days in rags
While I enjoy the life they'll never have
Yet deep within their eyes
Hope still survives
And they don't seem to think this world's so bad

Even as they gather in the square
They know a better life exists out there
With unity and pride
Faith stays alive
How can I pretend that I don't care?

I have always felt alone
Living like a stranger inside of my own home
Maybe now's the time to greet the wings of change
Could my destiny
Be right in front of me?

As a child behind the palace walls
Often times I'd search its secret halls
And hoping I would find
A treasure cast aside
I came upon the greatest gift of all

My music player
My private paradise
My music player
A refuge I must hide

Been lost at sea forever
Adrift and far away
Now finally for the first time
I know I found my way

"Three Days"

[EXT. Ravenskill Town Square - Day]

[Nafaryus:]

The admiration
The applause and the cheers
I am impressed
You've brought us all to tears

To think I didn't notice
The way you looked at her
Now step down from your throne
And let me bring you back to earth

Need I remind you?
I am the ruler here
Don't overlook that fact

Swearing allegiance
To anyone but me
No, I won't put up with that

Hide and protect him
Send him away
I'll never play this game

Stand by your savior
One thing remains
I'll find him just the same

[Imperial Guards:]

Brace yourself
Bow down to Nafaryus

Pray for help
Kneel before Nafaryus

[Nafaryus:]

He'll surrender on his own
If not, there'll be hell to pay
I'll tear down this city stone by stone
You only have three days

Send home the rebels
Call off the fight
In no uncertain terms

Should you refuse me
Fear for your lives
Ravenskill shall burn

[Imperial Guards:]

Brace yourself
Bow down to Nafaryus

Pray for help
Kneel before Nafaryus

[Narrator:]

With this frightening decree
Nafaryus departs
They're left to weigh the gravity
Of his threatening remarks

Judgement day will soon arrive
In only three days time
Will Gabriel get out of this alive?
This remains the question on their minds

"Brother, Can You Hear Me?"

[EXT. Ravenskill Rebel Command - Day]

[Arhys & Rebel Militia]

Brother can you hear me?
Your life is in my hands
I will not surrender
Never yield to his demands
If we stand together
We will never fall
Brother we're the answer to your call

Brother can you hear me?
You must not be afraid
I will march beside you
Have no fear
Be strong
Be brave

We sing the song of freedom
Our voices will resound
Brother we will never let you down

[Gabriel:]

On the road to revolution
We're bound to make mistakes
There's a price that we must pay
For every choice we make

Freedom is a reason
To stand up or give in
But someone has to lose
And someone has to win

Brother can you hear me?
I am not afraid
I will not forsake you
I'll be strong and I'll be brave
I sing the song of freedom
My courage knows no bounds
Brother now I stand on solid ground
Brother I will never let you down
Never let you down

"A Life Left Behind"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Night]

[Faythe:]

I never knew
Someone was out there
A long way from nowhere
Who could open my eyes

All of this time
While I was sleeping
The world changed around me
Now I've never felt more alive

I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up

[Arabelle:]

Fate found a way
To bring them together
Once and forever
And won't let them go

Nothing I say
Can keep her from leaving
Her life has new meaning
I lost her a long time ago

[Faythe:]

I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up

I'm waking up
Now that yesterday's gone
Won't close my eyes again
I'm waking up

I'll plan to return well disguised
Make sure that I'm not recognized
Tomorrow a new sun will rise
And somehow I'll find you

Nothing will stand in my way
Soon I will see you again

I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up

I'm waking up
Now that yesterday's gone
Won't close my eyes again
I will never look back
I'm waking up

[Arabelle:]

You'll be her shadow as she moves my son
But she can never know you're there
She is alone and rebel guards are everywhere

[Daryus:]

I'll keep her safe from all danger
Won't let her out of my sight

Did I fail to mention my honest intentions?
This is the chance I deserve
Heed my words justice will be served

"Ravenskill"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Narrator:]

Morning breaks beyond the night
And she's a world away
Through crowded streets
This quiet hooded stranger makes her way

[Faythe:]

Please, excuse me
Sir can you help me?
Where can I find this man?

[Townsperson:]

Sorry, can't speak
Someone is waiting

[Faythe:]

Yes, I understand

[Narrator:]

As her will
Starts to fade
And all but disappears

Like a ghost
Suddenly a boy is standing there
And all is clear

[Faythe:]

I'm your friend
Trust me don't be scared
I am looking for your father and I promise
I can help
Now take my hand
We haven't time to spare

[Narrator:]

Hopeful and innocent
Sensing no danger
He sees humanity
Behind the stranger's eyes

Her true identity
Will be revealed when she sheds her disguise

[EXT. Rebel Training Camp - Day]

[Faythe:]

My intentions are faithful
There's a chance we can still end this game
I'd be forever grateful
To see him once again

[Arhys:]

You dare to stand
Before my eyes
You're one of them
Why would I trust you?

[Faythe:]

It's not like that
I can't go back
Hope fades away
With each passing second

Lost in this moment
Is where I want to stay
This can't be broken
We need to find a way
Gabriel

I would wait a lifetime
Just to see your face
But all we have is one more day

[Gabriel:]

I remember your father was moved by my song
I know when he sees we're united that he'll understand
We will walk this road together
We will face this hand in hand

With music and love on our side we can't lose this fight
Tomorrow our dream comes alive

"Chosen"

[INT. Gabriel's Hideout - Night]

[Gabriel:]

Her words ring true
Her message clear
How can he hear
Through all the noise and dissonance?

I've seen a sign
That he can change
If given just a chance

Against all hope
We found a way
And it is all because she trusts in me

Why have a gift
You can't embrace
When all you need is faith

And there's a reason now I see
The reason I've been chosen
She sees the light inside of me
A reason to believe

But I can't climb this mountain without you
No I can't face this on my own
With you by my side we will open his eyes
And the truth will deliver us home

And there's a reason now I see
The path that he has chosen
He fears the light inside of me

In the absence of song
He's forgotten right from wrong
Our voices will release him
He's refused to listen far too long

I'm convinced beyond a doubt
There can be no other way
He just has to hear me out
There's so much I need to say

But I can't climb this mountain without you
No I can't face this on my own
With you by my side we will open his eyes
And the truth will deliver us home

[Daryus:]

Trustful boy
Unaware who's watching
Open the door
I am right behind you

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night]

[Daryus:]

Don't resist me child
There's no use in fighting
We'll be here a while
Do you recognize me?

Look into my eyes
I'm the face of freedom
When daddy does arrive
He's in for a surprise

[Arhys:]

How dare you step inside my home!

[Daryus:]

His life is in my hands

[Arhys:]

You monster leave my son alone!

[Daryus:]

You do know who I am
Your love for him is strong

[Arhys:]

He's just a boy
He's done no wrong
This fight's not his to lose
I have everything you want

[Daryus:]

Your next decision
Will decide his fate
So listen to the words I have to say

Give up The Chosen One
And you will guarantee your son
Lives the life you never had

Wealth and prosperity
Beyond what you have ever seen
And best of all Xander will be free

He'll never want again
It's such an easy choice
Just think about your son

And I won't have to stand
In Faythe's dark shadow anymore
I am through with being pushed aside
Tired of fighting for my father's pride

Take the evening to decide

"The X Aspect"

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night]

[Arhys:]

Betray my blood
To save my son
A hopeless choice to make

But who am I
If not the one
Who's meant to keep him safe?

Is trust and loyalty still justified
If I deny him of a better life?

Gabriel
Has always been
The strength I call upon

But nothing breaks
A father's will
To do what must be done

Should I turn my back on him?
Abandon all our plans for revolution?
Will hope and freedom die by morning light?

Evangeline
I swore to you
To love and guide our son

Destiny
Has shown his face
And now the time has come

Desperation blinds me
And through these bloodstained eyes I see the light
A better life is worth this sacrifice

"A New Beginning"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Faythe:]

Father I implore you
Don't believe a word
He is not the enemy
That is just absurd

You may see his talent
As some kind of threat
But I knew we were meant to be
From the day we met

Give us both a chance
For a new beginning
Nothing would mean more to me

He is just a man
Can't you show him mercy?
Sympathy and strength go hand in hand

[Nafaryus:]

This man's a fraud and a hoax
He'll only shatter your hopes
Saddest of all is to watch how you fall
For this person who you hardly know

[Faythe:]

Ignorant and stubborn
You have no respect
Not just for your flesh and blood
But all who you protect

Listen without judgement
Keep an open mind
If you cannot see the truth
You're the one who's blind

We don't stand a chance
That is his opinion
Mother can you talk to him?

[Arabelle:]

Try to understand
How they must be feeling
Misery's to know what might have been

[Nafaryus:]

Why would I ever concede
To listen to this fool? How can you be so naive?
You must be living in a world of make believe
Do you really think this charlatan is who he claims to be?

[Arabelle:]

Not long ago there was a time and place
You too possessed the same desires as Faythe

You knew how it felt to feel invisible
Music calmed your soul just like a drug
Remember Bug?

[Faythe:]

Father is it true
Bug was always you?
Finally I can reveal
How music makes me feel

Now you understand
Why I was hiding
This changes everything

[Nafaryus:]

I will grant the chance
For a new beginning
In the end the final word rests with me

"The Road To Revolution"

[INT. Gabriel's Hideout - Day]

[Faythe:]

He only sees what he desires to see
It took a while but finally he agreed
Though everything may not turn out as planned
If love's a risk
It's worth the chance

[Gabriel:]

I know where there is faith there's always hope
We'll meet beneath the stars at Heaven's Cove
Where ghosts of yesterday
Once filled the lighted stage
Taking our first step down a new road

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Daryus:]

Arhys time is running out
What will your decision be?
If you still have any doubt
Think about Evangeline

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]

On the road to revolution
Our salvation's never free
There's a price for liberation when you stand for your beliefs

When the man in the mirror
Takes a long hard look at me
Will the person staring back, be the man I want to be?

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Nafaryus:]

Change my mind?
A waste of time
For soon he will be mine

Brace yourself my brother
I have breaking news
The Noise Machines lie still tonight
There's no time to lose

No more threats of bloodshed
No more pain and fear
Ravenskill will brave the storm
Our victory is near

You are acting very strange
Nervous and on edge
I will be a voice for change
Brother give me strength

[Arhys:]
Burning rose, secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death, blood revenge
Moment of betrayal

I have sworn to live and die
By the warrior's code
Never leave a man behind
May God redeem my soul

I will give you what you need
My brother for my son
Guilt and shame will burden me
Until my days are done

Meet me tonight where the stars touch the sky
He'll be alone there with nowhere to hide

Burning rose, secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death, blood revenge
Moment of betrayal

He will be defenseless
I'll look on, say I put up a fight
There will be no witness
They will call you a hero tonight

Burning rose, secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death, blood revenge
Moment of betrayal

Threats and lies, changing sides
Moment of betrayal
Risking all, savior's fall
Moment of betrayal

[Narrator:]

Under the glow of the midnight moon
Where the stars touch the sky
Stand the long forgotten remains of a time gone by

Heaven's Cove was a wondrous site
Once a beautiful place
Now an empty shell like a memory that time erased

As the pivotal moment draws closer
Every shadow and whisper ignite
Music will rise like a phoenix from the ashes on this night

"Begin Again"

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Faythe:]

I gave up hope
Was dead inside
Stayed lost within a world I chose to hide
Then I found my faith in him
And now I can
Begin again

I once believed
Our fate was sealed
But now at last the truth has been revealed
In an instant life could change
And now and then
Begin again

I know that I am meant for something more
That life beyond these walls
Has greater things in store

When I heard his voice I realized
I'd never be the same
Instantly I knew my life had changed

I dream of peace
Above all else
To share a world where we could be ourselves
We must learn to rise above the past
Before we can at last
Begin again

"The Path That Divides"

[EXT. Heaven's Cove Ampitheater - Night]

[Narrator:]

The evening stars shine brightly
Over heaven's cove
As night descends in silence
The fated scene unfolds
Consumed with trepidation
Arhys hears his brother's voice

[Gabriel's Voice:]

As you're facing the path that divides
I will always be here by your side

[Arhys:]
I feel my pulse begin to race
Beads of sweat drip down my face
I have made a grave mistake
What have I done?
My blood for my son?

It's not too late
I won't betray him

[Daryus:]

I knew the day had come
And you could be tempted
To give up The Chosen One
And finally end this
Do anything for your son
A terminal weakness
But now you're as good as done

[Arhys:]
I didn't have a choice
And I was defenseless
I didn't believe his voice
And fighting was senseless
But now I can see the truth
I've come to my senses
I shouldn't have trusted you

[Narrator:]

Arhys was never aware
His son had followed him there
Confused and deathly afraid
X watched his hero be brave

[Arhys:]

On the path that divides
You were there by my side
There will be no betrayal tonight

I found courage and strength
In the words you once sang
Tore the truth from the lies
On the path that divides

[Daryus:]

You dare defy your prince?
Well you just threw your life away
Along with Xander's dreams
You chose the wrong man to betray

[Narrator:]

Two hungry warriors
Clash in the shadows of the night
But there's a cost with every fight
And Arhys' fight for hope
Cost him his very life

My father's dead
Your day will come

Don't hold your breath
The night's still young
Confront your death
Like father, like son

Who's this I see?
Approaching me
The Chosen One?

[Narrator:]

Drawing closer pace by pace
The walking shadow hides its face
Never aware of the looming attack
Like stepping right into a trap

As his weapon
Finds its victim
Mortified,
He's shocked to find
The shadow is Faythe

Angels above
Have you deceived my eyes?
Be still my love
I won't leave your side

All my life
I have walked alone
Now I've found my home in you
Only I'm too late

Have I wandered into someone's nightmare?
This is more than any heart can bear

You stole my brother's life
How many more have to die
Before you will open your eyes?

Don't leave me now
Hold on for one more breath
Stay strong somehow
This can't be the end

All your life
You have walked alone
Now I am your home
So take my hand and don't let go

Crushing pain and crippling grief
Nothing like I've ever felt
God above and souls beneath
Hear my last farewell

"Losing Faythe"

[EXT. Heaven's Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Nafaryus:]

My foolish pride
My selfish heart
Lost in the dark
Blinded by my arrogance

And now you beg for one last breath
And I'm the one to blame

There's a reason now I see
The reason you have chosen
To find the light inside of me
If only I believed

[Arabelle:]

Here I am
Don't be afraid
I will never let you slip away

Look my way
You must be brave
Find the strength to live for one more day

I will keep from losing Faythe
I will ask for grace
And hope will find a way

[Narrator:]

Like a candle's dying flame
With forgiving eyes
She starts to drift away

[Nafaryus:]

Gabriel, my son
I see the tide is turning
Can The Chosen One
Keep her fire burning?

I would trade my life
Just for one last moment

Use your gift I beg
May life begin again
May life begin again

"Whispers On The Wind"

[EXT. Heaven's Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Gabriel:]

If I still had something left
I'd surely use my gift
To give her one more breath
To see her smile again
And yet my gift is gone
Along with all her dreams
It vanished with a scream
My fragile voice has all but disappeared
I've nothing left to give
The words I wish I'd said
Just whispers on the wind
And now all hope is dead

"Hymn Of A Thousand Voices"

[EXT. Heaven's Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Narrator:]

Out of the shadows
One by one they came
To shed their light upon his moment of doubt and pain

A thousand voices
Rang out through the night
A symphony of mercy for their savior
Too tired to fight

And as the chorus grew
A thousand hearts beat true
Then like a glowing beacon in the dark
Hope came shining through

Amazingly the savior found his voice
And all together they rejoiced

[Gabriel and Townspeople:]

Glorious sound
Guide her tonight
Out of the darkness
Into the light

Merciful song
Set her soul free
Unbind the chains of endless sleep

Choirs on high
Grant her new life
Make me a vessel of thy boundless grace
Music has shown her the way
She lives today!

Like your father once said
Life is not what you're given
It is how you decide to live
On the path you have chosen

So together we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

[Faythe:]

I know you're scared and alone
But we will face this together
Through the innocence in your eyes
They will live on forever

In their memory we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

[Gabriel, Faythe and X:]

We'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

Together we'll build a new world

We'll build a new world
A bold new world

"Astonishing"

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Arhys' Spirit:]
Brother, can you hear me?
His life is in your hands
He is just a child and still too young to understand
Show him love and courage
That freedom knows no bounds
Tell him he could never let me down

[Xander:]
Father, I will make you proud
Rest in peace

[Gabriel:]
I always had the answer
All this time I held the key
And now that I see
The reason to believe
I can be the man who I am meant to be

[Faythe:]
Because of you I live again
Now I can be a voice for change
And help to build a world that's fair and true
So they can live the life they never knew

[Nafaryus:]
On the road to revolution
There are lessons to be learned
All the things you thought that mattered
Are lost at every turn

When the light of my existence
Was slipping through my hands
Pride and ignorance receded
To reveal a humbled man

[Arabelle:]
My prince, my son,
You got lost along the way
In light of this new burden that you face
You are forgiven on this day

[Ensemble:]
People, can you hear us?
Peace has been restored
The silence has been broken
Music reigns forever more

We sing a song of freedom
Together we are bound
People, we shall never hold you down
We will build our world on common ground

And we'll live once more
Eternally
In harmony
Our lives will be
Astonishing
Again

"The Enemy Inside"

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden within
Open wounds hidden under my skin

Pain is real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Staring at me crying

[CHORUS]
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I sever myself from the world
and shut down completely
All alone in my own living hell
overcome with irrational fear

Under the weight of the world on my chest
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath
Tell me I'm not dying

[CHORUS]
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I'm a burden and a travesty
I'm a prisoner of regret
Between the flashbacks and the violent dreams
I am hanging on the edge

Disaster lurks around the bend
Paradise came to an end
And no magic pill
can bring it back again

[CHORUS]
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

"The Looking Glass"

I would not expect you felt unnoticed and ignored
Better to rise above the clouds Then be a stranger in the crowd
All that you protected doesn’t matter anymore
Rather be stripped of all your pride
Than watch your dreams be cast aside

You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying stardom
Singing your own praise

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You are not content with being nameless and unknown
Trying to rise above the fray
Eager to give it all away

Some will not admit that 15 minutes have expired
Too much attention much too soon
Don’t see you walking on the moon

You are caught up in your gravity
Bathing in the spotlight
Imitating fame

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying madness
Singing your own praise

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

"The Bigger Picture"

Long before the colors start to bleed
I can see the painting come alive
Clever like an angel in disguise 
Moving in and out of reach 

If the candle lights this crooked path
Like a lighthouse peering through the haze
I will find the river through the rain 
And I’ll reach the water’s edge 

Shed your light on me
Be my eyes when I can’t see 
Shed your light on me 
Be my guide so I can see
The Bigger Picture 

Like a moth burned by the fire 
and driven to the flame 
(Prophecies’ a blessing and a curse) 
I must bare this cross alone
There’s no one else to blame 
With each treasure found
Another shipwreck’s washed ashore
I am carried by the current
On a slow and steady course 

[CHORUS] 

What If caught in a moment 
I get lost and can't find my way
What if all along i was wrong 
In every turn, In every way 

Would you talk me off the ledge 
Or let me take the fall 
Better to try and fail 
then to never try at all 

You look but cannot see
Talk but never speak
You live but cannot breathe
See but don’t believe 

Wounds that never heal
A heart that cannot feel
A dream that’s all too real 
A stare as cold as steel

I’ve listened to the stories of resentment and disdain
I’ve looked into the empty eyes of anger, fear, and shame
I’ve taken blood from every stone 
And traveled every road 

When I see the distant lights illuminate the night
Then I will know I am home 

<|endoftext|>

"Behind The Veil"

What would possess you to justify
Such dark and twisted ways?
What kind of monster would come to feast
When the devil shows his face?
What does it take for life to change
And a mind to lose control?
Cruelly left you to suffer the blame
After all the lies you told

I am finding courage in my darkest hour
I am bent, not broken
Calling out

Someone save me, look behind the veil
Please don't walk away
Someone save me, bring me home tonight
I can't face another day

Can you see the stranger
Hiding in plain sight?
Feeding on the chaos
When the lightning strikes
There's no redemption
There's no being saved
There's no salvation
For a soul depraved

You are finding promise in your finest hour
You are bent, not broken
Calling out

<|endoftext|>

"Surrender To Reason"

In moments of pain 
Where heart and mind collide
Self reflection helps me decide
I believe the sacrifices in life
Give more than they take 

Visions flowing slowly shedding light
Memories swimming in the sea of time
Pieces to the puzzle falling into place
That with which we struggle through we’ve learned to embrace 

Love show the way, alter my state of mind
Wash away the sorrow 
Grace lead the way
When boundaries are found
Surrender to reason

Life gives you brighter days 
Through sacrifices made
My spirit travels like the wind and waves
My heart and mind unite
Mistakes resolved give sight 
The river’s currents slowly turns the stone 

Restless angels
Help me find my way
Restless angels 
Help me find my strength 

Restless angels 
Help me find my way
Restless angels 
Let love show the way
Let grace be the way 
Surrender to reason

"Along For The Ride"

At this moment words fail me
And my vision's unclear
Blind to the truth
Like hands reaching out in the darkness

[CHORUS]
I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride

Through the gift of surrender
I'm embracing the fight
Breaking the code
There's clarity on the horizon

[CHORUS]
I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride

I will not live under a shadow of fear
Never be crippled by chaos and doubt
Fall prey to your madness

I am not shattered
Out of the ashes I rise
Knowing that nothing is stronger than faith
Finding hope in our hopeless lives

[CHORUS]
I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride

I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride

"Illumination Theory"

[I. Paradoxe de la Lumière Noire]

[Instrumental]

[II. Live, Die, Kill]

Consider this question 
Look deep inside 
Deliver a true confession 
What are you willing to live for? 

Consider this question
Open your eyes 
Examine your own reflection 
What are you willing to die for? 

When your backs’ against the wall 
And the time's uncertain
Consider this question
No standing by
When flesh and blood are threatened 
What are you willing to kill for? 

We seek to understand
We cry with head in hand 

The bridges we build to connect 
The distance that makes us forget
Hate dividing us, love reminding us
Of our shared humanity 

Hope can be a shadow fleeting
I would rather die believing 
Capture it all in a final act of faith 

We seek to understand 
We cry with head in hand 

A story that needs to be told
An answer that begs to be found
The beauty we wish to behold
Is never too far away 

[III. The Embracing Circle]

[Instrumental]

[IV. The Pursuit Of Truth]

Mothers for their children
Husbands for their wives
Martyrs for the kingdom
Fighting for your life
A soldier for his country
A junkie for the high
Teachers for their students 
Vengeance for a crime
Rebels for their freedom
A tyrant for the praise
Cowards for salvation
Money, love, and fame

Noble and brave
Lay down our lives for the cause
Death over shame
Grace before glory 

[V. Surrender, Trust & Passion]

To really feel the joy in life
You must suffer through the pain
When you surrender to the light 
You can face the darkest days

If you open up your eyes
And you put your trust in love
On those cold and endless nights 
You will never be alone

Passion glows within your heart
Like a furnace burning bright 
Until you struggle through the dark
You’ll never know that you're alive

<|endoftext|>

"On The Backs Of Angels"

Standing on the backs of angels
Destined to create
Mounting the attack
While heroes carry your weight

We spiral towards disaster
Survival fading faster

Riding out the wave
Content to feed off the machine
Bleeding us to death
The new American dream

You're blinded by your hunger
Beware your days are numbered

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

Blurring lines drawn in between
What is right and what is wrong
Victims on the radar string us along

We're on to your agenda
The dead end road to nowhere

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

"Build Me Up, Break Me Down"

Today I will be your savior
Tomorrow ‒ a demon
You crave my erratic behavior
And watch my every move

Obsession at all cost
You'll be the death of me
Broken and torn apart
Why can't you let me be?

You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces
I crash and burn
I never learn
I'm your guilty addiction

Build me up
Break me down

Tonight I am the new messiah
You deify
When I'm no longer desired
I'll be crucified

The one who's free from sin
The first to cast the stone
Fighting the fear within
I won't be left alone

You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces
The price I pay
To live this way
And the fantasy stays alive

I can't live up
I can't let down
And leave you falling to pieces
I crash and burn
I never learn
I'm your morbid obsession.

Build me up
Break me down

You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces
The price I pay
To live this way
And the fantasy stays alive

I can't live up
I can't let down
And leave you falling to pieces
I crash and burn
I never learn
Your iconic fixation

Build me up
Break me down

Build me up
Break me down

"Lost Not Forgotten"

I am not immortal
I am just a man
A power-craving tyrant
Beyond the shadows in the sand

Men have come to fear me
Many bow and cry
Known across the desert
I am the one who will not die

I have faced the demons of our most desperate moments
I have been the one to defend our pride
I have worn the banner of my abandoned brothers
I will be the first one to give my live

Lost not forgotten
Reigning against the odds
Feared and respected living among the gods
Leading the empire
Spirit as black as coal
Lost not forgotten
King of the deathless soul

An Epic novel no one's read
Pages torn and faded
The greatest story never told

Behold the kingdom I possess
Land of wealth and beauty
Where the streets are paved with gold

Once fearless and brave
A realm passed away
The ghosts of yesterday

Lost not forgotten
Reigning against the odds
Feared and respected living among the gods
Leading the empire
Brutal and heartless
Vanishing further
Into the darkness
Lost not forgotten
King of the deathless soul

"This Is The Life"

In the heart of your most solemn barren night
When your soul's turned inside out
Have you questioned all the madness you invite?
What your life is all about

Some of us choose to live gracefully
Some can get caught in the maze
And lose their way home
This is the life we belong to
Our gift divine

Have you ever wished that you were someone else?
Traded places in your mind
It's only a waste of your time

Some of us choose to live gracefully
Some can get caught in the maze
And lose their way home
This is the life we belong to
Our gift divine

Feed the illusion you dream about
Cast out the monsters inside
Life begins with an empty slate
Fragile left in the hands of fate
Driven by love and crushed by hate
Until the day the gift is gone
And shadows remain

Some of us choose to live gracefully
Some can get caught in the maze
And lose their way home
Memories will fade
Time races on
What will they say after you're gone?
This is the life we belong to
Our gift divine
Our gift divine

"Bridges In The Sky"

Blackness awakens
Visions come alive
Seeing through darkness
With borrowed eyes

Death survivor
Take me higher
Reunite my soul

Whisperer of truth
I trust in you
To make me whole

Sun
Come shine my way
May healing waters bury all my pain

Wind
Carry me home
The fabric of reality is tearing apart
The piece of me that died
Will return
To live again

Feeling myself slip away
Suddenly dreaming awake
Hidden memories
Flooding back

I will not grow in the light
Until I pass through the darkest caverns of my heart

Dance with fire
Spirit guide erase the world outside

Messenger of truth
I trust in you
Transform me now

Sun
Come shine my way
May healing waters bury all my pain

Wind
Carry me home
The fabric of reality is tearing apart
The piece of me that died
Will return
To live again

And at last the time has come
To unite again as one

To the power of the Earth I'm calling
Crossing bridges in the sky
On a journey to renew my life
Shaman take my hand

"Outcry"

Somewhere overhead
Distant thunders roars
The revolution has begun
The war to end all wars

As I welcome death
I hear the battle cry
Bullets fall like fire
Raining from the sky

The rebel in us all
Someday gets tired
Of being pushed around
But freedom has a price
The cost is buried in the ground

We suffered far too long
We gather now growing stronger
We will not be ignored
Anymore any longer
Our anthem will guide us

Rise up, be counted
Stand strong and unite
Wait for the outcry
Resistance is calling tonight

Far too many years
Of chaos and unrest
Far too many voices
Brutally suppressed

We fight for what is just
For all that we believe
We fight till death or glory
Fight to be set free

The street are bathed in blood
Time to step down
And time to walk away
You'll never rule me now
Though you may stand upon my grave

You can look the other way
Or you can face the light
Although it seems so far away
Freedom's worth the fight

Rise up, be counted
Stand strong and unite
Wait for the outcry
Resistance is calling

Rise up, be counted
Stand strong and unite
Wait for the outcry
Resistance is calling tonight

The world watches on
While we risk our lives
Locked in a kingdom of fear
As our children die

"Far From Heaven"

No one truly has the answers
Every day I struggle through it once more
Keep things bottled up
Never speaking my mind
Misinterpreted I'm doing just fine

Every day I put a brave face on
Serves me well
Feeling helpless facing it alone
Hard to tell
That I can't change who I am
How I feel there's no end

I have done
What you asked of me
Leaves me nothing to live for

Coming undone
Way too high a price
I should pay
You keep your pride
While I die inside
Every day
No I
Can't lie anymore
Won't pretend
I've done
All I can

You can't imagine
The hell I'm going through
Not asking you to save me
I'm too far from heaven

Nothing you can do to change me
But accept me as I am

"Breaking All Illusions"

With the sun in place
There's a test of faith
Streams of thought awaken

New realities
Singularities
Breaking all illusions

[Spoken words:]
“Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.”
“Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.”

Sudden bust of heat
Burning source of life
Masterful destruction

Power's not an act
It's understanding truth
Changing my direction

Live in the moment
Breathe in a new beginning
Wisdom revealed
As I unlearn to learn

Life's biggest battles
Often are fought alone
My spirit brings me home

Emerald thoughts flow through my consciousness
Drawn to curses left behind
Test of will the threshold to one's faith
Starts a fire in the mind

Searching out
Reaching in
To arrive
Where I began
Sights remembered
In the light

Searching out
Reaching in
To arrive
Where I began
Sights remembered
Come alive

Embrace the days
Don't turn away
Life's true intent needs patience
Karma starts the signal

"Beneath The Surface"

Is there ever really a right time?
You had led me to believe
Someday you'd be there for me
When the stars above aligned
When you weren't so consumed
I kept looking for the clues
So I waited in the shadows of my heart
And still the time was never right

Until one day I stopped caring
And began to forget why I longed to be so close
And I disappeared into the darkness
And the darkness turned to pain
And never went away
Until all that remained was buried, deep beneath the surface

A shell of what things could've been
Tired bones beneath a veil of guarded secrets all too frail
Sad to think I never knew
You were searching for the words
For the moment to emerge
Yet the moment never came
You couldn't risk my fragile frame

Until one day you stopped caring
And began to forget why you tried to be so close
And you disappeared into the darkness
And the darkness turned to pain
And never went away
Until all that remained was buried, deep beneath the surface

I would scream just to be heard
As if yelling at the stars
I was bleeding just to feel
You would never say a word
Kept me reaching in the dark
Always something to conceal

Until one day I stopped caring
And began to forget why I longed to be so close
And I disappeared into the darkness
And the darkness turned to pain
And never went away
Until all that remained was buried, deep beneath the surface
Beneath the surface

"A Nightmare To Remember"

A nightmare to remember
I'd never be the same.
What began as laughter
So soon would turn to pain.
The sky was clear and frigid
The air was thick and still
Now I'm not one to soon forget
And I bet I never will

Picture for a moment
The perfect irony
A flawless new beginning
Eclipsed by tragedy.
The uninvited stranger
Started dancing on his own
So we said goodbye
To the glowing bride
And we made our way back home.

Life was so simple then
We were so innocent.
Father and mother
Holding each other.

Without warning
Out of nowhere
Like a bullet
From the night
Crushing Glass
Rubber and steel
Scorching fire
Glowing lights
Screams of terror
Pain and Fear
Sounds of sirens
Smoke in my eyes
Sudden stillness
Blackened silence
No more screaming
No more cries

Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed

Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed

Lying on the table
In this unfamiliar place
I'm greeted by a stranger
A man without a face
He said, "Son, do you remember?
Do you even know your name?"
Then he shined a light into my eyes
And said, "take this for the pain."

Hopelessly drifting,
Bathing in beautiful agony.
I am endlessly falling,
Lost in this wonderful misery.
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
And all of the panic inside starts to fade.
Hopelessly drifting,
Bathing in beautiful agony.

"Tell me does this hurt you?"
Said the faceless man.
"Can you move all of your fingers?
Can you try your best to stand?"
I asked about the others
Is everyone OK?
He told me not to worry
As he turned and looked away.

Hopelessly drifting,
Bathing in beautiful agony.
I am endlessly falling,
Lost in this wonderful misery.
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
And all of the panic inside starts to fade.
Hopelessly drifting,
Bathing in beautiful agony.

Day after day
And night after night
Replaying the events
Did they ever see the red light?

Over and over
Scene by scene
Like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams.
How can you prepare for what would happen next?
No son should ever have to see his father such a mess
It's a miracle he lived
It's a blessing no one died
By the Grace of God above
Everyone survived

Life was so simple then
We were so innocent.
It will stay with us forever
A nightmare to remember

"A Rite Of Passage"

Since the new world order
Played upon our fears
Spreading accusations
Of radical ideas

The brotherhood of wisdom
Strength and dignity
Its rituals and secrets
Remain a mystery

Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key
Walk through the gate
The great ascent
To reach a higher state
A rite of passage

The final stage
A sacred home
Unlock the door
And lay the corner stone
A rite of passage

Men of wealth and power
Influence and fame
Philosophers and leaders
Are members of the trade

Bound by oath and honor
Like the rose and cross
An enigmatic union
Of esoteric thought

Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key
Walk through the gate
The great ascent
To reach a higher state
A rite of passage

The final stage
A sacred home
Unlock the door
And lay the corner stone
A rite of passage

Turn the key
Walk through the gate
The great ascent
To reach a higher state
A rite of passage

The seven stars
The rising sun
A perfect world
Where new life has begun
A rite of passage

"Wither"

Let it out, let it out
Fill the empty space
So insecure
Find the words
And let it out

Staring down, staring down
Nothing comes to mind
Find the place
Turn the water into wine

But I feel I'm getting nowhere
And I'll never see the end

So I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I break down
And let the story guide me

Turn it on
Turn it on
Let the feelings flow
Close your eyes
See the ones you used to know

Open up open up
Don't struggle to relate
Lure it out
Help the memory escape
Still this barrenness consumes me
And I feel like giving up

So I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I break down
And let the story guide me

I wither
And give myself away

Like reflections on the page
The world's what you create

I drown in hesitation
My words come crashing down
And all my best creations
Burn into the ground
The thought of starting over
Leaves me paralyzed

Tear it out again
Another one that got away

I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear

I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I break down
And let the story guide me
I wither
And give myself away

Like reflections on the page
The world's what you create

"The Shattered Fortress"

[X. Restraint]

Freedom calls my name
Serenity keeps me sane
Happiness -- it dulls the pain

Honest to see my place
Open to other ways
Willingness to understand

Justice but do not judge
Courtesy for others' flaws
Kindness -- it's not that hard

Self-restraint of tongue and pen
Inventory -- my daily friend
Analysis let down your guard

Look in the mirror
What do you see?
The shattered fortress
That once bound me

Faithful ascent, through darkest fires
I've found the path to take me higher

You're smart enough for me to trust go live your life now
Just keep these steps in your life and you'll know how
If you're not sure, ask yourself,
"Have I done to them as I would have them do to me?"

Look in the mirror
What's that you see?
The shattered fortress
Fly now be free

Faithful ascent, through darkest fires
I've found the path to take me higher

I once thought it better to be right
But now I have finally seen the light
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn from mistakes
I live with serenity now
Not self-righteous hate

[XI. Receive]

(Help me be a channel of Thy peace
That where there is hatred, I may bring love;
That where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness;
That where there is discord, I may bring harmony;
That where there is error, I may bring truth;
That where there is doubt, I may bring faith)

Now that you can see all you have done
(That where there is despair, I may bring hope;
That where there are shadows, I may bring light)

It's time to take that step into the kingdom
(That where there is sadness, I may bring joy)

All your sins will help to make you strong
(That I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted.
That I may seek to understand than to be understood)

And help you break right through the prison wall
(That I may seek to love, rather than to be loved,
for it is by self-forgetting that one finds,
it is by forgiving that one is forgiven)

Keep all of me,
The desires that once burned me deep inside
Help me live today
And help to give me grace
To carry out your way

I am ready, help me be all I can be
I am ready, help guide me and keep me free

[XII. Responsible]

I am responsible when anyone, anywhere
Reaches out for help, I want my hand to be there
I am responsible when anyone, anywhere
Reaches out for help, I want my hand to be there

"The Best Of Times"

Remember days of yesterday
How it flew so fast
The two score and a year we had,
I thought it would always last
Those summer days and west coast dreams
I wished would never end
A young boy and his father,
Idol and best friend

I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
A lifetime together
I'll never forget

The morning shows on the radio
The case of the missing dog
Lying on the pillows at the old 812
Watching Harold and Maude
The record shops, the stickball fields
My home away from home
And when we weren't together
The hours on the phone

I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
I'll cherish them forever
The best of times

But then came the call
Our lives changed forever more
"You can pray for a change
But prepare for the end..."

The fleeting winds of time
Flying through each day
All the things I should've done
But time just slipped away
Remember seize the day
Life goes by in the blink of an eye
With so much left to say

These were the best of times
I'll miss these days
Your spirit lit my life each day

Thank you for the inspiration
Thank you for the smiles
All the unconditional love
That carried me for miles
It carried me for miles
But most of all thank you for my life

These were the best of times
I'll miss these days
Your spirit lit my life each day
My heart is bleeding bad
But I'll be OK
Your spirit guides my life each day

"The Count Of Tuscany"

Several years ago
In a foreign town
Far away from home
I met the Count of Tuscany

A young eccentric man
Bred from royal blood
Took me for a ride
Across the open countryside

Get into my car
Let's go for a drive
Along the way
I'll be your guide
Just step inside

Maybe you recall
A cannibal curator
A character inspired by my brother's life

Winding through the hills
The city far behind
On and on we drove
Down narrow streets and dusty roads

At last we came upon
A picturesque estate
On sprawling emerald fields
An ancient world of times gone by

Let me introduce
My brother
A bearded gentleman
Historian
Sucking on his pipe
Distinguished accent
Making me uptight
No accident

I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die

Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive

I-
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Would you like to see
Our secret holy place?
I come here late at night
To pray to him by candle light

Then peering through the glass
I saw with disbelief
Still dressed in royal clothes
The saint behind the altar

History recalls
During times of war
Legend has been traced
Back inside these castle walls

Where soldiers came to hide
In barrels filled with wine
Never to escape
These tombs of oak are where they died

Down the cellar stairs
I disappear
Like the angel's share
The end is near

Come and have a taste
A rare vintage
All the finest wines
Improve with age

I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive

I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Could this be the end?
Is this the way I die?
Sitting here alone
No one by my side

I don't understand
I don't feel that I deserve this
What did I do wrong?
I just don't understand

Give me one more chance
Let me please explain
It's all been circumstance
I'll tell you once again

You took me for a ride
Promising a vast adventure
Next thing that I know
I'm frightened for my life

Now wait a minute man
That's not how it is
You must be confused
That isn't who I am

Please don't be afraid
I would never try to hurt you
This is how we live
Strange although it seems
Please try to forgive

The chapel and the saint
The soldiers and the wine
The fables and the tales
All handed down through time

Of course you're free to go
Go and tell the world my story
Tell about my brother
Tell them about me
The Count of Tuscany...

[I Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[II Resurrection]

I saw a white light
Shining there before me
And walking to it
I waited for the end
A final vision
Promising salvation
A resurrection
For a fallen man

Do you still wait for your God
And the symbol of your faith?

I can free you from this Hell and misery
You should never be ashamed my son
I can give you power beyond anything
Trust me you will be the chosen one

I was forgotten
A body scorned and broken
My soul rejected
Tainted by his blood

Beyond redemption
A sinner not worth saving
Forever taken
From the one I loved

Do I still wait for my God
And a symbol of my faith?

I can lead you down the path and back to life
All I ask is that you worship me
I can help you seek revenge and save yourself
Give you life for all eternity

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their saviour's calling
Of this wicked day

Through a veil of madness
With a vicious blade
One man rises up
Standing in their way

Redemption
Redemption for humanity

"Forsaken"

For a while I thought I fell asleep
Lying motionless inside a dream

Then rising suddenly
I felt a chilling breath upon me
She softly whispered in my ear
(Forsaken)

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand
Give yourself up to me

I waited painfully
For night to fall again
Trying to silence the fear within me

Out of an ivory mist
I felt a stinging kiss
And saw a crimson stain on her lips

I have to know your name
Where have I seen your face before?
My dear one don't you be afraid

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand
Give yourself up to me

Take me far away
Close your eyes
And hold your breath
To the ends of the earth

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand

Forsaken
Fly away with me tonight
Awaken
Renew my life
Now you are mine
Give yourself up to me

"Constant Motion"

Tunnel vision at blinding speed
Controlling my thoughts, obsessing me
Void of any uncertainty
Throughout my very soul

Lost illusions of mind control
Resisting all hope of letting go
Racing impulse of dark desire
Drives me through the night

I try to shut it down
It leaves me in the dust
No matter what I've found
I can never get enough

Frantic actions of insanity
Impulsive laced profanity
Long for elusive serenity
Way out of my control

Traveling through both space and time
(Out of body, out of mind)
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
(I can't let up, I can't let go)
Can't stop this flame from burning
Forever more
Into the night
Blistering

Focus here, focus there
Cannot see the light
(Falling down through the night)
Sprawling everywhere

Searching left, searching right
(Panic setting in, I can no longer fight)
When will this end?

Accelerate, dislocate
(Set to crash and burn, haven't got time to waste)
Not planning to return

Aggravate, agitate
(When will I ever learn?)
There's no way out of here
Nowhere to turn

Obsessive yearning
Compulsive burning
Still never learning
Insane random thoughts
Of neat disorder

Scattered wasteland surrounding me
Tattered memories of what used to be
Apocalyptic mind debris
Until we meet again

Traveling through both space and time
(Out of body, out of mind)
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
(I can't let up, I can't let go)
Can't stop this flame from burning
Forever more
Into the night
Blistering

Traveling through both space and time
(Out of body, out of mind)
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
(I can't let up, I can't let go)
Can't stop this flame from burning
Can't stop the wheels from turning

Traveling through both space and time
(You get yours, and I got mine)
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
(I can't let up, I can't let go)
Can't stop this flame from burning
Forever more
Into the night
Blistering

"The Dark Eternal Night"

No one dared to
Speak of the terrible danger
The hideous ancient warnings
Forged in the void of night

He has risen up
Out of the blackness chaos
The last of the prophets sinister
A sickening monstrous sight

Through the stifling heat
Underneath the pale green moon

I burned with a thirst
To seek things not yet seen

Climbing endless stairs
Leading to the choking room

Eager to explore
His most shocking mysteries

Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night

Black forces
Rage in the vortex,
Fighting
Waves of destruction
Swallowing
The echo of the universe

I am the last
Born of the blood of the pharaohs
The ultimate god of a rotting creation
Sent to unleash this curse

Restless crowds draw near
Nameless hooded forms appear

Amidst fallen ruins
Grotesque creatures battle

Shadowed on a screen
Yellow evil faces leer

Vacant monuments
Corpses of dead worlds left behind

Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night

Trapped in a hellish dream
Spinning past worlds unseen
And frightfully vanishing
Into the dark eternal night

[Solos]

Drifting beyond all time

"Repentance"

[VIII Regret]
Hello, mirror, so glad to see you my friend
It's been a while...

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage running through my head
Patterns of my life I thought adorned me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament

Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life
that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking about the dreaded task in store for me
A pit of fear at the thought of my amends

Hoping that this step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this unswept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

[IX Restitution]

"Until that moment, I'd never felt like I'd failed at anything...And I felt like I failed her...And I failed myself, and I failed my children...It's still really hard to deal with."

"I want to thank you for helping me to see my own selfishness and to tell you how regretful I am it has hurt you."

"I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital, Grandpa when you were on your deathbed. I'm sorry I didn't come to your funeral...I don't know if I was selfish or just too scared to face it. It's one of the biggest regrets of my life."

"I'm here to confess with you that what I did, was wrong... And I'm asking for your forgiveness..."

"The only unforgivable thing hauls itself out of bed, looks over my shoulder at the bloody English weather..."

"I really regret not being able to see my friend Andy..."

"One of my best friends who's the godfather of my daughter, he asked me to sing or play something at his wedding, and I turned it down because I was busy and too much of a chicken shit to do it...And I feel sorry for that, because it was a very very close friend of mine..."

"So, I wanted to apologize to anyone that I've upset or offended.. they're just words, it's just an opinion, but unfortunately, I tend to express it as a fact, and that's kind of arrogant. Isn't it?"

"I think it's the betrayal...it still haunts me."

"I'm sorry for what I did back then... I was a different person. I really was and I'm so sorry. I wish it wouldn't have happened, but it did, and I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'm sorry..."

"I guess I'm simply sorry for being me and not you. I so often wish you could be here with me to show me the way..."

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development, we will be amazed before we are half way through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace.
No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.

Are these extravagant promises? We think not. They are being fulfilled among us - sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. They will always materialize if we work for them.

"You're only as sick as your secrets, but the truth shall set you free..."

"The truth is the truth and the only thing you can do is to live with it."

<|endoftext|>

"Prophets Of War"

It burns deep down inside of me,
We have ourselves to blame.
Not questioning, accepted as the truth.

Debate this fight it's just cause
The facts do not support theirs
To liberate a people
And rid them of tyrant rule

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?

It's time to make a change.

Intrigued
Got your attention - deceived
Since the inception - our brave
Fight for what reason

Compelled
Can we clean up this mess?
The loss of loved ones
A perverse request
They continue the same rhetoric
These derelicts that profit
Win or lose

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?
It's time to make a change

Time for change
Fight the fear
Find the truth
Time for change

The only thing
That I believe
Will help us see this through is faith.
Pray they will forgive,
Forgive our arrogance,
So we can make it right,
Right what they have wronged.

See you sweat
Unexpected, controversial
Get used to it
Things are gonna get personal
Your sympathy
A pitiful display you stutter
Your empathy
Means nothing if there is no honor
Responsible
Of this you are incapable
We implicate
Incriminate - Exacerbate - Too much at stake

Our Fathers, Mothers
Sisters, Brothers
Sons and Daughters
Forced
Perpetuating their ideals
A mindless act
To stay the course

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?
Is it time to make a change?
A change from what it's been
Can we help them break away?
Is our patience wearing thin?
It's time to make a change

Time for change
Fight the fear
Find the truth
Time for change

"The Ministry Of Lost Souls"

The water's edge
Is where she waits
Lost soul still wandering
Meant to die
But she's stuck not crossing over

The other side
Is where he waits
His spirit reaching out
Meant to save
But she's too scared
to take his hand

Living in a world without you
(drowning in the past)
Is living in no world at all
So now I call on you

Remember me?
I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering
was all in vain
It's almost over now
Don't turn your back on paradise

Feeling scared, she's prepared
To give up everything
She can't stand
to feel like half of her is fading

He will choose
the only way
To rid her of her pain
Take her soul now
The decision has been made

Living in a world without love
(a burden to my soul)
Is living in a worthless world
So I will call on you...

Remember me?
I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering
was all in vain
It's almost over
Remember me?
You were so young
How could I tell you?
Remember me?
I am the one
Who saved your life that night

I was the one
who would not abandon you
Even in death
I was the one
who would not leave you
I used my freedom to protect you
And all the while direct you
Do you remember me this time?
Even in death I gave you life
I gave you life

I wanted to deserve a place
A place beside you
This time when I reached out my hand
It reached all the way to heaven

Remember me?
I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering
was all in vain
It's almost over now
Goodbye
It's almost over now
Goodbye

It's time
I release you from this life
Don't turn your back on paradise

[III. Heretic]

Welcome tired pilgrim
Into the circle
We have been waiting

Everyone's gathered
for your arrival
All the believers

Angels fall
all for you
heretic
Demon heart
bleed for us

I've been waiting for you,
Weary preacher man
You have been expected
Now we can begin
Let this hallowed Day of Judgment reign

I have known you father
And your sacred quest
Blessed soldier fighting
You shall never rest
I have known you but do you know me?

Angels fall
all for you
heretic
Demon heart
bleed for us

(My soul is yours Dark Master, I will fight for you)

Dark Master within, I will fight for you
Dark Master of sin, now my soul is yours
Dark Master, my guide, I will die for you
Dark Master inside�

I cannot see his face
But I could feel his spite
A presence from the dead
Abandoned by the light
This shadow will consume him
from within

This power that I sense
The rage behind those eyes
Is just a shrouded ghost
A spirit sealed inside
The body and the soul both threats
For they are one

Angels fall
all for you
heretic
Demon heart
bleed for us

(My soul is yours Dark Master, I will fight for you)

Dark Master within, I will fight for you
Dark Master of sin, now my soul is yours
Dark Master, my guide, I will die for you
Dark Master inside�
Dark Master, amen, I belong to you
Dark Master within�

Heil! Heil! Heil! Heil!
Heil! Heil! Heil! Heil!

[IV. The Slaughter of The Damned]

Don't
Bother trying to find them
They will be coming to you
Fight,
Fight and destroy until you can't take anymore

Slay
Spill the blood of the rebels
They are the children of hell
Flesh,
Of the undead
Stopping at nothing to kill

Sin,
Caught in a moment of weakness
Committed the greatest of all
Sold,
Half of my soul
And now it's too late for you

I judge us
my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us

Unwelcome ones
your time has come

Lord,
You are my god and my shepherd
Nothing more shall I want
Walk,
Through the abyss
Into the shadow of death

Fear,
There is no evil to fear now
For I know you are with me
My,
Cup overflows
With my enemy's blood

I,
Decay in the house of the lord
Forever, amen
Death,
Will follow me
All the days of my life

I judge us
my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us
Unwelcome ones
your time has come

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their savior's calling
On this wicked day

Through a veil of madness
With a vicious play
One man rises up
Standing in their way

It's time for your reckoning

[V. The Reckoning ]

[Instrumental]

[VI. Salvation]

My soul grows weaker
He knows and he waits
He watches over me
Standing at the infernal gates
In the hour of darkness
The moment I feared has passed
The moment I lost my faith
Promising salvation
My soul is my own now
I do not fight for you
Dark Master

"The Root Of All Evil"

[VI. Ready]

Proud enough for you to call me arrogant
Greedy enough to be labeled a thief
Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man
Cruel enough for me to feel no grief

Never could have just a part of it
I always need more to get by
Getting right down to the heart of it
The root of all evil has been running my whole life

Dirty enough for me to lust
Leaving nothing left to trust
Jealous enough to still feel envious
Lazy enough to sleep all day
And let my life just waste away
Selfish enough to make you wait for me

Driven blindly by our sins
Misled so easily
Entirely ready to leave it behind
I'm begging to break free

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast them all away
And help to give me strength to face another day
I am ready
Help me be what I can be

[VII. Remove]

Self-centered fear has got a hold of me
Clutching my throat
Self righteous anger running all through me
Ready to explode

Procrastination paralyzing me
Wanting me dead
These obsessions that keep haunting me
Won't leave my head

Help to do for me what I can't do myself
Take this fear and pain
I can't break out this prison all alone
Help me break these chains

Humility now my only hope
Won't you take all of me
Heal this dying soul

I can feel my body breaking
I can feel my body breaking
I'm ready to let it all go
I can feel my body shaking
Right down to the foundation
The root of it all

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast it all away
And help to give me strength to face another day
I am ready
Help me what I can be
I am ready
Come to me
Take me away

"The Answer Lies Within"

Look around,
Where do you belong
Don't be afraid,
You are not the only one

Don't let the day go by,
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by in doubt,
The answer lies within

Life is short, so learn from your mistakes
And stand behind, the choices that you made
Face each day with both eyes open wide
And try to give, don't keep it all inside

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by, in doubt,
The answer lies within

You've got the future on your side
You've gonna be fine now
I know whatever you decide
You are gonna shine!!! (shinee)

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by, in doubt
You re ready to begin

Don't let a day go by in doubt
The answer lies within

"These Walls"

This is so hard for me
To find the words to say
My thoughts are standing still

Captive inside of me
All emotions start to hide
And nothing's getting through

Watch me,
Fading
I'm losing
All my instincts,
falling into darkness

Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows
I'm holding back

It's not too late for me,
To keep from sinking further
(I'm trying to find my way out,
Tear down these walls for me now)

So much uncertainty
I don't like this feeling
I'm sinking like a stone

Each time I try to speak
There's a voice I'm hearing
And it changes everything

Watch me,
Crawl from
The wreckage
Of my silence
Conversation
Failing

Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows
I'm holding back

It's not too late for me,
To keep from sinking further
(I'm trying to find my way out,
Take down these walls)

Everytime you choose to turn away
Is it worth the price you pay?
Is there someone who will wait for you
One more time? [x2]

Watch me,
Fading
I'm losing
All my instincts,
Falling into darkness

Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows
I'm holding back

It's not too late for me,
To keep from sinking further
(I'm trying to find my way out,
Tear down these walls for me now)

Tear down these walls for me
It's not too late for me
Tear down these walls for me

"I Walk Beside You"

There's a story in your eyes
I can see the hurt behind your smile
For every sign I recognize
Another one escapes me

Let me know what plagues your mind
Let me be the one to know you best
Be the one to hold you up
When you feel like you're sinking

Tell me once again
What's beneath the pain you're feeling
Don't abandon me
Or think you can't be saved

I walk beside you
Wherever you are
Whatever it takes
No matter how far
Through all that may come
And all that may go
I walk beside you
I walk beside you

Summon up your ghosts for me
Rest your tired thoughts upon my hands
Step inside this sacred place
When all your dreams seem broken

Resonate inside this temple
Let me be the one who understands
Be the one to carry you
When you can walk no further

Tell me once again
What's below the surface bleeding
If you've lost your way,
I will take you there

I walk beside you
Wherever you are
Whatever it takes
No matter how far
Through all that may come
And all that may go
I walk beside you
I walk beside you

Oh, when everything is wrong
Oh, when hopelessness surrounds you
Oh, the sun will rise again
The tide you swim against
Will carry you back home
So don't give up
Don't give in

I walk beside you
Wherever you are
Whatever it takes
No matter how far
Through all that may come
And all that may go
I walk beside you
I walk beside you

"Panic Attack"

All wound up
On the edge
Terrified

Sleep disturbed
Restless mind
Petrified

Bouts of fear
Permeate
All I see

Heightening
Nervousness
Threatens me

I am paralyzed
So afraid to die

Caught off guard
Warning signs
Never show

Tension strikes
Choking me
Worries grow

Why do I feel so numb
Is it something to do with where I come from
Should this be fight or flight
I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight

Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest
Agitated body in distress
I feel like I'm in danger
Daily life is strangled by my stress

A stifling surge
Shooting through all my veins
Extreme apprehension
Suddenly I'm insane

Lost all hope for redemption
A grave situation desperate at best

Why do I feel so numb
Is it something to do with where I come from
Should this be fight or flight
I don't know why I'm constantly reeling

Helpless hysteria
A false sense of urgency
Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety

Run
Try to hide
Overwhelmed by this complex delirium

Helpless hysteria
A false sense of urgency
Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety

Run
Try to hide
Overwhelmed by this complex delirium

"Never Enough"

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

Sacrifice my life
Neglect my kids and wife
All for you to be happy
All those sleepless nights
And countless fights to give you more
And then you say how dare that
I didn't write you back
I must be too good for you
I only care about myself

What would you say
If I walked away
Would you appreciate
But then it'd be too late
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

"Sacrificed Sons"

[Begins with samples from 9/11]

Walls are closing
Anxiously
Channel surfing
Frantically

Burning City
Smoke and fire
Planes we're certain
Faith inspired

No clues
A complete surprise
Who'll be
Coming home tonight

Heads all turning
Towards the sky
Towers crumble
Heroes die

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

Teach them what to think and feel
Your ways so enlightening
Words they preach I can't relate
If God's true Love are acts of Hate?

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

God on High
Our mistakes
Will mankind be extinct?

There's no time,
Time to waste
Who serves the truth
For Heavens' sake?

"Octavarium"

[I. Someone Like Him] [0:00 ‒ 8:47]

I never wanted to become someone like him so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that
This was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd
Never be someone like him

So many years have passed
Since I proclaimed
My independence
My mission
My aim
And my vision
So secure
Content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know
That I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm
Missing out this time

As far as I could tell
There's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself
Could this be everything
Then all I swore
That I would never be was now
So suddenly
The only thing
I wanted
To become
To be someone just like him

[II. Medicate (Awakening)] [8:48 ‒ 13:49]

A Doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep

For 30 years
Where have I been
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

Medicate me
Infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away

Medicate me
Science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can't you stop what's happening

A higher dosage he prescribes
But there's no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There's no one who's to blame
A second shot
A brief awakening

I feel the relapse
Can't break free
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

[III. Full Circle] [13:50 – 16:36]

Sailing on the seven seize the day tripper diem's ready
Jack the ripper Owens Wilson Phillips and my supper's ready
Lucy in the sky with diamond Dave's not here I come to save the
Day for nightmare cinema show me the way to get back home again

Running forward
Falling back
Spinning round and round
Looking outward
Reaching in
Scream without a sound

Leaning over
Crawling up
Stumbling all around
Losing my place
Only to find I've come full circle

Flying off the handle be careful with
That axe Eugene gene the dance machine
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba
Hey hey my my generation's home again

Running forward
Falling back
Spinning round and round
Looking outward
Reaching in
Scream without a sound

Leaning over
Crawling up
Stumbling all around
Losing my place
Only to find I've come full circle

[IV. Intervals] [16:37 – 19:53]

[Root]
Our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path

[Second]
Asking questions
Search for clues
The answer's been right in front of you

[Third]
Try to break through
Long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath

[Fourth]
Loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire

[Fifth]
Tortured Insanity
A smothering hell
Try to escape but no avail

[Sixth]
The calls of admirers
Who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more

[Seventh]
Innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madmen's impulsive designs

[Octave]
Step after step
We try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it has become too late

Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium

[V. Razor's Edge] [19:54 ‒ 24:00]

We move in circles
Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor's edge

A perfect sphere
Colliding with our fate
This story ends where it began

"As I Am"

Don't
Tell me what's in
Tell me how to write
Don't tell me how to win
This fight
Isn't your life
It isn't your right
To take the only thing that's
Mine

Proven over time
It's over your head
Don't try to read between the
Lines
Are clearly defined
Never lose sight of
Something you believe in

Takin' in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog

I've been trying to justify you
In the end I will just defy you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, Take me as I am

As I am

Still
Running uphill
Swimming against the current
I wish I weren't so
Fucked
Feels like I'm stuck
Lost in a sea of mediocrity

''Slow down,
You're thinking too much
Where is your soul?''
You cannot touch
The way I
Play
Or tell me what to say
You're in the way
Of all that I believe in

Takin' in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog
I've been wasting my breath on you
Open minds will descend upon you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, take me as I am

"This Dying Soul"

[IV. Reflections of Reality (Revisited)]

Hello, Mirror - so glad to see you my friend, it's been a while
Searching, Fearless - where do I begin to heal this wound of self-denial

Face yourself man!
Brace yourself and trace your hell back

You've been blinded, living lie a one way cold existence all the while
Now it's time to stare the problem right between the eyes you long lost child

I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking and shaking and left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making a change to fix this dying soul

Born into this world a broken home
Surrounded by love yet all alone
Forced into a life that's split in two
A mother and a father both pulling you

Then you had to deal with loss and death
Everybody thinking they know best
Coping with this shit at such an age
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage

Family disease pumped through your blood
Never had the chance you thought you could
Running all the while with no escape
Turning all that pain in to blame and hate

Living on your own by twenty one
Not a single care and having fun
Consuming all the life in front of you
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue

Possessive obsessions selfish childish games
Vengeful resentments
Passing all the blame
Living out a life of decadence
Acing without thought of consequence
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast
While spitting on the ones that matter most

Running power mad with no control
Fighting for the credit they once stole
No one can ever tell you what to do
Ruling other's lives while the can't stand the thought of you

A living reflection seen from miles away
A hopeless affliction having run astray

I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking and shaking and left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making a change to fix this dying soul

Now that you can see all you have done
It's time to take that step into the kingdom
All your sins will only make you strong
And help you break right through the prison wall

[V. Release]

Come to me my friend (Listen to me)
I'll help this torture end (Help to set me free)
Let your ego go (I can't carry this load)
You can't go through this alone (I feel so hopeless and exposed)
You'll find your peace of mind (Give me some direction)
You can no longer hide (Break out of this isolation)
Let humility (Openness, honesty)
And become what you can be (A healing tranquility)

Help me
Save me
Heal me
I can't break out of this prison all alone

These tormenting ghosts of yesterday
Will vanish when exposed
You can't hold onto your secrets
They'll only send you back alone

Your fearless admissions
Will help expel your destructive obsessions
With my help I know you can
Be at one with God and man

Hear me
Believe me
Take me
I'm ready to break right through this prison wall

Dedicated to Bill W. and all of his friends

"Endless Sacrifice"

Cold
Lying in my bed
Staring into darkness

Lost
I hear footsteps overhead
And my thoughts return
Again

Like a child who's run away
And won't be coming back
Time keeps passing by
As night turns into day

I'm so far away
And so alone
I need to see your face
To keep me sane
To make me whole

Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind
Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice

Pain
It saddens me to know
The helplessness you feel
Your light
Shines on my soul
While a thousand candles
Burn

Outside this barren room
The rain is pouring down
The emptiness inside
Is growing deeper still

You're so far away
And so alone
You long for love's embrace
To keep you sane
To make you whole

Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind

Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

Over the distance
We try to make sense
Of surviving together
While living apart

Striving for balance
We rise to the challenge
Of staying connected
In spite of circumstance

All you've forsaken
And all that you've done
So that I could live out
This undying dream

Won't be forgotten
Or taken for granted
I'll always remember
Your endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice

"Honor Thy Father"

We're taught unconditional love
That blood is thicker than water
That a parent's world would revolve
Always around their son or their daughter

You pretended I was your own
And even believed that you loved me
But were always threatened by some
Invisible blood line that only you could see

You took advantage of an outreached hand
And twisted it to meet your every need
'Gimme time to re-charge my batteries,
I'll see her when she's older and I'll bounce her on my knee'

Well listen to me you ungrateful fool
Here comes a dose of reality
You'll go to your grave a sad and lonely man
The door is now closed on your pathetic little plan

On and on and on and on it goes
It's so easy to run away with nothing in tow

How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the nerve to blame this mess on me

Never in my life have I seen someone
So Ignorant to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree

I tried your four bill therapy
I tried to make amends
But nothing could lure you out of your selfish shell again
Expecting everyone to bow and kiss your feet
Don't you see respect is not a one way street
Blaming everyone for all that you've done wrong
I'll get my peace of mind when you hear this song

On and on and on and on it goes
And with every passing day true colors show

How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the balls to blame this mess on me

Never in my life have I seen someone
Oblivious to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree

Watch where you walk
Don't you dare cross the crooked step
Watch the way you talk
Don't cross the crooked step

[spoken:]
"This is a regret that you make"
"we're still connected"
"This is a regret that you make-"
"I want my family back"
"-and there's something you take"
"You can't have it. I'm sorry for you, but it's too late..."
"Mistakes like this...You don't make"
"Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you?"
"You make some...And they'll get to you"
"You don't love anybody"
"I gave you money, I gave you a car, I took you in-"
It's not OK, son"
"-but don't that mean something?"
"Do I admire people too much?"
"No...You should do better"
"That disappoints you..."
"God damn regrets!"
"You deserve to die alone for what you have done!"
GOD DAMN REGRETS!"
"Don't deny it"
"You cocksucker, I know you're here."
"Don't deny it"
"I want you to know I hate your fucking guts."
"The biggest regret in my life"
"I wish you'd fucking die."
"I've let my love go"
"I'm your blood...I'm your family"
"Is that you?"
You're not my family, not anymore"
"The fucking regrets!"
"When your own flesh and blood renounces you..."
"What did I do?"
"...you have no choice but to renounce them."
"WHAT DID I DO?"

On and on and on and on it goes
Chauvinistic, heartless, selfish, cold

How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the balls to blame this shit on me

Never in my life have I seen someone
So fucking blind to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree

"Vacant"

Hey you, Hey you
I'm right here
Conscience fading
Can't get through

Oh Lord
Helpless
Confused
Head swayed
Eyes glazed
And mine teared

She's losing control
What can I do
Her vacant eyes
Black holes
Am I losing you

"In The Name Of God"

How can this be?
Why is he the chosen one?

Saint gone astray
With a scepter and a gun

Learn to believe
In the mighty and the strong

Come bleed the beast
Follow me it won't be long

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God

Straight is the path
Leading to your salvation
Slaying the weak
Ethnic elimination

Any day we'll all be
Swept away
You'll be saved
As long as you obey

Lies
Tools of the devil inside
Written in Holy disguise
Meant to deceive and divide
Us all

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God

Blurring the lines
Between virtue and sin
They can't tell
Where God ends
And mankind begins

They know no other
Life but this
From the cradle
They are claimed

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God

Hundreds of believers
Lured into a doomsday cult
All would perish
In the name of God

Self-proclaimed messiah
Led his servants
To their death
Eighty murdered
In the name of God

Forty sons and daughters
Un-consenting plural wives
Perversions
In the name of God

Underground religion
Turning toward
The mainstream light
Blind devotion
In the name of God

Justifying violence
Citing from the Holy Book
Teaching hatred
In the name of God

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God

Religious beliefs
Fanatic obsession
Does following faith
Lead us to violence?

Unyielding crusade
Divine revelation
Does following faith
Lead us to violence?

[Chant:]
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord
he is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored
he hath loosed the fateful lightning
of his terrible swift sword
his truth is marching on.

glory, glory, hallelujah
glory, glory, hallelujah
glory, glory, hallelujah...

"The Glass Prison"

[I. REFLECTION]

Cunning, Baffling, Powerful
Been beaten to a pulp
Vigorous, Irresistable
Sick and tired and laid low
Dominating, Invincible
Black-out, loss of control
Overwhelming, Unquenchable
I'm powerless, have to let go

I can't escape it
It leaves me frail and worn
Can no longer take it
Senses tattered and torn

Hopeless surrender
Obsession's got me beat
Losing the will to live
Admitting complete defeat

Fatal Descent
Spinning around
I've gone too far
To turn back round

Desperate attempt
Stop the progression
At any length
Lift this obsession

Crawling to my glass prison
A place where no one knows
My secret lonely world begins

So much safer here
A place where I can go
To forget about my daily sins

Life here in my glass prison
A place I once called home
Fall in nocturnal bliss again

Chasing a long lost friend
I no longer can control
Just waiting for this hopelessness to end

[II. RESTORATION]

Run - fast from the wreckage of the past
A shattered glass prison wall behind me
Fight - past walking through the ashes
A distant oasis before me

Cry - desperate crawling on my knees
Begging God to please stop the insanity
Help me - I'm trying to believe
Stop wallowing in my own self pity

"We've been waiting for you my friend
The writing's been on the wall
All it takes is a little faith
You know you're the same as us all"

Help me - I can't break out this prison all alone
Save me - I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own
Heal me - I can't restore my sanity alone

Enter the door
Desperate
Fighting no more
Help me restore
To my sanity
At this temple of hope

I need to learn
Teach me how
Sorrow to burn
Help me return
To humanity
I'll be fearless and thorough
To enter this temple of hope

Believe
Transcend the pain
Living the life
Humility
Opened my eyes
This new odyssey
Of rigorous honesty

Serenity
I never knew
Soundness of mind
Helped me to find
Courage to change
All the things that I can

"We'll help you perform this miracle
But you must set your past free
You dug the hole, but you can't bury your sole
Open your mind and you'll see"

Help me - I can't break out this prison all alone
Save me - I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own
Heal me - I can't restore my sanity alone

[III. REVELATION]

Way off in the distance I saw a door
I tried to open
I tried forcing with all of my will and still
The door wouldn't open
[replaced with "but" in this line]

Unable to trust in my faith
I turned and walked away
I looked around, felt a chill in the air
Took my will and turned it over

The glass prison which once held me is now gone
["now" is not heard in this line]
A long lost fortress
Armed only with liberty
And the key of my willingness

Fell down on my knees and prayed
"Thy will be done"
I turned around, saw a light shining through
The door was wide open

"Blind Faith"

Hear me, speaking
Asking why I even bother
Tell me, how you
Live from day to day

Take your time and look around
Is this utopia you've found

Sick of all of this
The suffering and we just carry on
Isn't it time we care and lose the hate
Understand our fears

But we do all that we can
Justify the means to an end
Sorry you must excuse me
I've painted my own Mona Lisa
She's fixed everything
Now I'm spoiled beyond my wildest dreams

Blind Faith we have in you
Invisible
Which direction do we choose
Predictable

Take the streets, the beaten path
Our system works for whom I ask
Yeah I have it all
The bigger house
An iron fence to keep you out

When did we all let you down
So come Messiah show us how how
Our human spirit drowns
Don't think you hear me now
No sign of you around
What is it you hope to see

Blind Faith we have in you
Invisible
Which direction do we choose
Predictable
Give us something we can use
Desirable
Cause you've done all you can do
Regrettable

And still life pushes on
With or without you
We've got to carry on
Our will, will guide us to
A place where we belong
Know there lies the truth
I am the believer who gives purpose on to you

I don't think we let you down
So come Messiah show us how how
Throw us a pure lifeline
I hope that you hear me
Too proud to be around
There's more to us than we see now

Blind Faith we have in you
Invisible
Which direction do we choose
Predictable
Self ignorance, abuse
Desirable
Cause you've done all you can do
Incredible

"Misunderstood"

Waiting
In the calm of desolation
Wanting to break
From this circle of confusion

Sleeping
In the depths of isolation
Trying to wake
From this daydream of illusion

How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me
How can I know so many
Never really knowing anyone

If I seem superhuman
I have been
Misunderstood

It challenges the essence of my soul
And leaves me in a state of disconnection
As I navigate the maze of self control

Playing a lion being led to a cage
I turn from a thief to a beggar
From a god to God save me

How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me
How can I know so many
Never really knowing anyone

If I seem superhuman
I have been
Misunderstood

Playing a lion being led to a cage
I turn from surreal to seclusion
From love to disdain
From belief to delusion
From a thief to a beggar
From a god to God save me

How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me
How can I know so many
Never really knowing anyone

If I seem superhuman
I have been
Misunderstood

"The Great Debate"

[also known as "Conflict At Ground Zero"]
[music by Myung, Petrucci, Portnoy, Rudess]
[lyrics by John Petrucci]

"A gallop snapshot poll taken immediately after President Bush's speach on
funding embryonic stem cell research last night shows that half of Americans
approve of his decision, 25% do not, and still another 25% are not sure what
to think."

"Most people don't even know what stem cells are."

"Who is going to scream the loudest? Will it be the right-to-lifers or will
it be the scientists? And now what is going to happen is there will be a
tremendous amount of lobbying in Washington, D.C.: scientists,
entertainers, people who want to see this research - will be coming forth."

"I am concerned about it. Christopher Reeves is concerned about it.
Everyone is concerned about it. The big question is do the ends justify
the means? When we talk about research, yes, we can cure a lot of things...
speculatively. But, where is the proof?"

"These developing human beings that you are talking about, these embryos,
were produced in an artificial, scientific environment. In vitro
fertilization is not God's will."

"That doesn't make them any less human, though, after that happens."

"We are on a road where we really don't know where we are going as far as
what's next. We are talking about harvesting embryos. We are talking about
this, we are talking about that, but what is the cost?"

"How could we possibly abandon the research?"

"That is right. That is the old question? If you think the research is good
then you may not have a problem with it. It is only if you think the
research is questionable that you get defensive about it. (You do have time
to research these embryos later if we choose to do so. While people are
suffering, we are not truly certain that this will provide a cure.)"

"And there was a great outrage in the conservative churches... You cannot
use developing humans... At that point in time they turn into humans."

"I feel that abandoning this research could be a mistake. Researching this
may allow us to save other lives or at least to improve the quality of
lives."

"We do not have the answers, yet. We need to put the money where we will get
those answers in the future. Listen, we are out of time."

What if someone said
Promise lies ahead
Hopes are high in certain scientific circles
Life won't have to end
You could walk again

What if someone said
Problems lie ahead
They've uncovered something highly controversial
The right to life is strong
Can't you see it's wrong

Humankind has reached a turning point
Poised for conflict at ground zero
Ready for a war
Do we look to our unearthly guide
Or to white coat heroes
Searching for a cure

Turn to the light
Don't be frightened of the shadows it creates
Turn to the light
Turning away would be a terrible mistake

Anarchistic moral vision
Industries of death
Facing violent opposition
Unmolested breathe

Ethic inquisitions breed
Antagonistic views
Right wing sound bite premonitions
In a labyrinth of rules

Are you justified
Are you justified
Are you justified
Justified in taking
Life to save life
Life to save life
Taking life to save life

This embryonic clay
Wrapped in fierce debate
Would be thrown away
Or otherwise discarded

Some of us believe
It may hold the key
To treatment of disease
And secrets highly guarded

Are you justified
Are you justified
Are you justified
Justified in taking
Life to save life
Life to save life
Life to save life

Human kind has reached a turning point
Poised for conflict at ground zero
Ready for a war
Do we look to our unearthly guide
Or to white coat heroes
Searching for a cure

Turn to the light
Don't be frightened of the shadows it creates
Turn to the light
Turning away would be a terrible mistake

We're reaching
But have we gone too far

Harvesting existence
Only to destroy
Carelessly together
We are sliding

Someone else's future
Four days frozen still
Someone else's fate
We are deciding

Miracle potential
Sanctity of life
Faced against each other
We're divided

Should we push the boundaries
Or should we condemn
Moral guilt and science
Have collided

Turn to the light
We defy our own mortality these days
Turn to the light
Pay attention to the questions we have raised

"One of the big questions that still remains for me, though, is that all of
these embryos that are sent or will be discarded - is this worse than just
throwing those away?"

"You do not know that all of these will be discarded. All of a sudden you
say which ones will be discarded. And all of sudden you have people being
solicited for parts of their anatomy. Then they harvest parts of people's
bodies. That is how it starts."

"People are not soliciting; there are fertility clinics that have extra
embryos."

"The research is a scientific advancement. I know we are going down a road
that we may not know where we end, but that is exactly what science is all
about. I am very sorry, but I do feel sympathy for those whose spines have
been severed... There is a possibility that we might cure them. I am
concerned about a cure for juvenile diabetes and if these types of
scientific advancement can cure these diseases, then quite candidly I think
there ought to be at least what President Bush has proposed: some limited
research."

"Stem cells come from developing human beings and they should not be
experimented on that doesn't make sense or that is unethical, but at the
same time there is great promise."

"I have a 28-year old son who is paraplegic. And if there is a small
chance that my son can be able to have feeling and be able to walk then I am
all for it."

"Human beings have been evolving for 10's of thousands of years and we are
just injecting cells from embryos into people's brains. How do we come to
do something like that?"

<|endoftext|>

"Disappear"

Why, tell me the reasons why
Try, still I don't understand
Will I ever feel this again
Blue sky, I'll meet you in the end
Free them, free the memories of you
Free me, and rest 'til I'm with you

A day like today
My whole world has been changed
Nothing you say
Will help ease my pain

Turn, I'll turn this slowly round
Burn, burn to feel alive again
She, she'd want me to move on
See me, this place I still belong
Give chase, to find more than I have found
And face, this time now on my own

Days disappear
And my world keeps changing
I feel you here
And it keeps me sane

So I'm moving on
I'll never forget
As you lay there and watched me
Accepting the end
I knew you were scared
You were strong I was trying
I gave you my hand
I said it's okay letting go time to leave here
And I'll carry on
The best that I can without you here beside me
Let him come take you home

"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence"

[I. OVERTURE]

[instrumental]

[II. ABOUT TO CRASH]

She can't stop pacing
She never felt so alive
Her thoughts are racing
Set on overdrive

It takes a village
This she knows is true
they're expecting her
And she's got work to do

He helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes
He says I've never seen her get this bad

Even though she seems so high
He knows that she can't fly
and when she falls out of the sky
He'll be standing by

She was raised in a small midwestern town
By a charming and eccentric loving father
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl
And everyone thought highly of her

And she tried everyday
With endless drive
To make the grade
Then one day
She woke up to find
The perfect girl
Had lost her mind

Once barely taking a break
Now she sleeps the days away
She helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
All she wants to do is cry
No one ever knew she was so sad

Cause even though she gets so high
And thinks that she can fly
She will fall out of the sky
But in the face of misery
She found hopefulness
Feeling better
She had weathered
This depression

Much to her advantage
She resumed her frantic pace
Boundless power
Midnight hour
She enjoyed the race

[III. WAR INSIDE MY HEAD]

Napalm showers
Showed the cowards
We weren't there to mess around

Through heat exhaustion
And mind distortion
A military victory mounted on innocent ground

Hearing voices from miles away
Saying things never said
Seeing shadows in the light of the day
Waging a war inside my head

Years and years of
Bloodshed and warfare
Our mission was only to get in and kill

A free vacation
Of palmtrees and shrapnel
Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell

Hearing voices from miles away
Saying things never said
Seeing shadows in the light of the day
Waging a war inside my head

Feeling strangers staring my way
Reading minds never read
Tasting danger with each word I say
Waging a war inside my head

[IV. THE TEST THAT STUMPED THEM ALL]

Standing in the darkness
Waiting for the light
The smell of pure adrenaline
Burning in the night

Random blinding flashes
Aiming at the stage
Intro tape begins to roll
Igniting sonic rage

Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all

"The boy is simply crazy
Suffering from delusions
We honestly think that maybe
He might need an institution

He lives in a world of fiction
And really could use some help
We have just the place to fix him
To save him from himself"

Curled up in the darkness
Searching for the light
The smell of stale sweat and shit
Streaming through the night

Random urine testing
Pills red, pink and blue
Counseling and therapy
Providing not a clue

Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all

"We can't seem to find the answers
He seemed such a clear cut case
We cannot just let him leave here
And put all this work to waste

Why don't we try shock treatment
It really might do some help
We have just the tools to fix him
To save him from himself"

[V. GOODNIGHT KISS]

Goodnight kiss in your nightgown
Lavender in your bed
So innocent as you lie down
Sweet dreams that run through your head

Are you lonely without Mommy's love?
I want you to know I'd die for that moment
You're just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all

It's been 5 years to the day and
My tainted blood's still the same
I can't help acting this way and
Those bastard doctors are gonna pay

I'm so lonely without baby's love
I want you to know I'd die for one more moment
I'm just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all

[VI. SOLITARY SHELL]

He seemed no different from the rest
Just a healthy normal boy
His mama always did her best
And he was daddy's pride and joy

He learned to walk and talk on time
But never cared much to be held
and steadily he would decline
Into his solitary shell

As a boy he was considered somewhat odd
Kept to himself most of the time
He would daydream in and out of his own world
but in every other way he was fine

He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell

A temporary catatonic
Madman on occasion
When will he break out
Of his solitary shell

He struggled to get through his day
He was helplessly behind
He poured himself onto the page
Writing for hours at a time

As a man he was a danger to himself
Fearful and sad most of the time
He was drifting in and out of sanity
But in every other way he was fine

He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell

A momentary maniac
With casual delusions
When will he be let out
Of his solitary shell

[VII. ABOUT TO CRASH (REPRISE)]

I'm alive again
The darkness far behind me
I'm invincible
Despair will never find me

I feel strong
I've got a new sense of elation
Boundless energy
Euphoria fixation

Still it's hard to just get by
It seems so meaningless to try
When all I want to do is cry
Who would ever know I felt so sad

Even though I get so high
I know that I will never fly
And when I fall out of the sky
Who'll be standing by

Will you be standing by

[VIII. LOSING TIME/GRAND FINALE]

She dresses in black everyday
She keeps her hair simple and plain
She never wears makeup
But no one would care if she did anyway

She doesn't recall yesterday
Faces seem twisted and strange
But she always wakes up
Only to find she'd been miles away

Absence of awareness
Losing time
A lapse of perception
Losing time

Wanting to escape
She had created a way to survive
She learned to detach from herself
A behavior that kept her alive

Hope in the face of our human distress
Helps us to understand the turbulence deep inside
That takes hold of our lives
Shame and disgrace over mental unrest
Keeps us from saving those we love
The grace within our hearts
And the sorrow in our souls
Deception of fame
Vengeance of war
Lives torn apart
Losing oneself
Spiraling down
Feeling the walls closing in
A journey to find
The answers inside
Our illusive mind

"Scene One: Regression"

[H:]
"Close your eyes and begin to relax. Take a deep breath, and let it out
slowly. Concentrate on your breathing. With each breath you become more
relaxed. Imagine a brilliant white light above you, focusing on this light as
it flows through your body. Allow yourself to drift off as you fall deeper and
deeper into a more relaxed state of mind. Now as I count backward from ten to
one, you will fill more peaceful, and calm. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. You
will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you. Five. Four. Three. Two. If
at any time you need to come back, all you must do is open your eyes. One."

[N:]
Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My subconscious mind
Starts spinning through time
To rejoin the past once again

Nothing seems real
I`m starting to feel
Lost in the haze of a dream

And as I draw near
The scene becomes clear
Like watching my life on a screen

Hello Victoria so glad to see you
My friend

"II. Strange Deja Vu"

[N:]
Subconscious strange sensation
Unconscious relaxation
What a pleasant nightmare
And I can`t wait to get there again

Every time I close my eyes
There`s another vivid surprise
Another whole life waiting
Chapters unfinished, fading

Closer now - Slowly coming into view
I`ve arrived - Blinding sunshine beaming through

There`s a house I`m drawn into
Familiar settings, nothing new
There`s a pathway leading there
With a haunting chill in the air

There`s a room at the top of the stairs
Every night I`m drawn up there
There`s a girl in the mirror
Her face is getting clearer
Young child won`t you tell me why I`m here?

In her eyes - I sense a story never told
Behind the disguise - There`s something tearing
At her soul

[V:]
Tonight I`ve been searching for it
A feeling that`s deep inside me
Tonight I`ve been searching for
The one that nobody knows
Trying to break free

I just can`t help myself
I`m feeling like I`m going out of my head
Tears my heart into two
I`m not the one the sleeper thought he knew

[N:]
Back on my feet again
Eyes open to real world
Metropolis surrounds me
The mirror`s shattered the girl

Why is this other life
Haunting me everyday
I`d break through the other side
If only I`d find the way

Something`s awfully familiar
The feeling`s so hard to shake
Could I have lived in that other world
It`s a link that I`m destined to make

I`m still searching but I don`t know what for
The missing key to unlock my mind`s door

Today I am searching for it
A feeling that won`t go away
Today I am searching for it
The one that I only know
Trying to break free

I just can`t help myself
I`m feeling like I`m going out of my head
Tears my soul into two
I`m not the one I thought I always knew

I just can`t help myself
I`m feeling like I`m going out of my head
Uncanny, strange Deja Vu
But I don`t mind - I hope to find the truth

"Scene Three: I. Through My Words"

[N:]
All your eyes have ever seen
All you`ve ever heard
Is etched upon my memory
I spoken through my words

All that I take with me
Is all you`ve left behind
We`re sharing one eternity
Living in two minds
Linked by an endless thread
Impossible to break

<|endoftext|>

"II. Fatal Tragedy"

[N:]
Alone at night
I feel so strange
I need to find
All the answers to my dreams

When I sleep at night
I hear the cries
What does this mean?

I shut the door and traveled to another home
I met an older man, he seemed to be alone
I felt that I could trust him
He talked to me that night;

"Lad did you know a girl was murdered here?"
"This fatal tragedy was talked about for years"
Victoria`s gone forever
Only memories remain
She passed away
She was so young

Without love
Without truth
There can be no turning back

Without faith
Without hope
There can be no peace of mind

As the night went on
I started to find my way
I learned about a tragedy
A mystery still today

I tried to get more answers
But he said, "You`re on your own"
Then he turned away and left me
As I stand there all alone
He said, "You`ll know the truth
As your future days unfold"

Without love
Without truth
There can be no turning back

Without faith
Without hope
There can be no peace of mind

"Scene Four: Beyond This Life"

[Headline:] "Murder, young girl killed
Desperate shooting at Echoe`s hill
Dreadful ending, killer died
Evidently suicide"

A witness heard a horrifying sound
He ran to find a woman dead and
Lying on the ground

Standing by her was a man
Nervous, shaking, gun in hand
Witness says he tried to help
But he`d turned the weapon on himself

His body fell across that poor young girl
After shouting out in vain
The witness ran to call for assistance
A sad close to a broken love affair

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

She wanted love forever
But he had another plan
He fell into an evil way
She had to let him down
She said "I can`t love a wayward man"

She may have found a reason to forgive
If he had only tried to change
Was their fatal meeting prearranged?

Had a violent struggle taken place?
There was every sign that lead there
Witness found a switchblade on the ground
Was the victim unaware?
They continued to investigate
They found a note in the killer`s pocket
It could have been a suicide letter
Maybe he had lost her love

I feel there`s only one thing left to do
I'd sooner take my life away than live with losing you

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

All that we learn this time
(What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life

<|endoftext|>

"Scene Five: Through Her Eyes"

[N:]
She never really had a chance
On that fateful moonlight night
Sacrificed without a fight
A victim of her circumstance

Now that I've become aware
And I've exposed this tragedy
A sadness grows inside of me
It all seems so unfair

I'm learning all about my life
By looking through her eyes

Just beyond the churchyard gates
Where the grass is overgrown
I saw the writing on her stone
I felt like I would suffocate

In loving memory of our child
So innocent, eyes open wide
I felt so empty as I cried
Like part of me had died

And as her image
Wandered through my head
I wept just like a baby

As I lay awake in bed

And I know what it's like
To lose someone you love
And this felt just the same

She wasn't given any choice
Desperation stole her voice
I've been given so much more in life
I've got a son, I've got a wife

I had to suffer one last time
To grieve for her and say goodbye
Relive the anguish of my past
To find out who I was at last

The door has opened wide
I'm turning with the tide
Looking through her eyes

"Scene Six: Home"

[The Sleeper:]
Shine-lake of fire
Lights take me higher
My mind drips desire
Confined and overtired

Living this charade
Is getting me nowhere
I can't shake this charade
The city's cold blood calls me home
Home it's what I long for
Back home where I belong

The city - it calls to me
Decadent scenes from my memory
Sorrow - eternity
My demons are coming to drown me

Help - I'm falling, I'm crawling
I can't keep away from its clutch
Can't have it, this habit
It's calling me back to my home

[The Miracle:]
I remember the first time she came to me
Poured out her soul all night and cried

I remember I was told there's a new love that's born
For each one that has died

I never thought that I
Could carry on with this life
But I can't resist myself
No matter how hard I try

Living their other life
Is getting them nowhere
I'll make her my wife
Her sweet temptations calls me home
Home it's what I long for
My home where she belongs

Her ecstasy - means so much to me
Even deceiving my own blood
Victoria watches and thoughtfully smiles
She's taking me to my home

Help - he's my brother, but I love her
I can't keep away from her touch
Deception, dishonor
It's calling me back to my home

[Nicholas:]
Her story - it holds the key
Unlocking dreams from my memory
Solving this mystery
Is everything that is a part of me

Help - regression, obsession
I can't keep away from her touch
Leave no doubt, to find out
It's calling me back to my home

"II. One Last Time"

[N:]
It doesn`t make any sense
This tragic ending
In spite of the evidence
There`s something still missing

Heard some of the rumours told
A taste of one`s wealth
Did Victoria wound his soul?
Did she bid him farewell?

One last time
We`ll lay down today
One last time
Until we fade away
One last time
We`ll lay down today
One last time
We slowly fade away

[N:]
Here I am inside his home
It holds the many clues
To my suspicions
And as I`m standing here right now
I`m finally shown what I have always known

Coincidence I can`t believe
As my childhood dreams slowly come true

Are these her memories
Awakened through my eyes
This house has brought back to life

An open door
I walk on through
Into his bedroom

Feeling as cold as outside
The walls disappear
To some woman who`s screaming
A man pleads forgiveness
His words I cannot hear

"Scene Eight: The Spirit Carries On"

[N:]
Where did we come from?
Why are we here?
Where do we go when we die?
What lies beyond
And what lay before?
Is anything certain in life?

They say " Life is too short"
"The here and the now"
And " You`re only given one shot"
But could there be more
Have I lived before
Or could this be all that we`ve got?

If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

I used to be frightened of dying
I used to think death was the end
But that was before
I`m not scared anymore
I know that my soul will transcend

I may never find all the answers
I may never understand why
I may never prove
What I know to be true
But I know that I still have to try

If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

[V:]
"Move on, be brave
Don`t weep at my grave
Because I`m no longer here
But please never let
Your memories of me disappear"

[N:]
Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My questioning mind
Has help me to find
The meaning in my life again
Victoria`s real
I finally feel
At peace with the girl in my dreams
And now that I`m here
It`s perfectly clear
I found out what all of this means

If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

"Scene Nine: Finally Free"

[Hypnotist:]
You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light.
Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime.
As the light dissipates you will slowly fade back into
consciousness, remembering all you have learned.
When I tell you to open your eyes you will return to the present,
Feeling peaceful and refresh.
Open your eyes Nicholas.

[Miracle:]
Friday evening
The blood still on my hands
To think that she would leave me now
For that ungrateful man
Sole survivor
No witness to the crime
I must act fast to cover up
I think that there`s still time
He`d seem hopeless and lost with this note
They`ll buy into the words that I wrote
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my love
I`ve finally broke free
No longer
Torn in two
I`d take my own life before losing you

[Victoria:]
Feeling good this Friday afternoon
I ran into Julian
Said we'd get together soon
He`s always had my heart
He needs to know
I`ll break free of the Miracle
It`s time for him to go
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my love
I`ve finally broke free
No longer
Torn in two
He`d kill his brother if he only knew
Their love renewed
They`d rendezvous
In a pathway out of view
They thought no one knew
Then came a shot out of the night
"Open your eyes, Victoria"

[Sleeper:]
One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
Until we fade away
One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
We fade away
As their bodies lie still
And the ending draws near
Spirits rise through the air
All their fears disappear
It all becomes clear
A blinding light comes into view
An old soul exchanged for a new
Familiar voice comes shining through

[Nicholas:]
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my life
I`m finally free
No longer
Torn in two
I learned about my life by living through you
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my life
I`ve finally free
No longer
Torn in two
Living my own life by learning from you
We`ll meet again my friend
Someday soon

"New Millennium"

A single star behind me
A red sky burns ahead
A lonely light below me
Awake among the dead
An overwhelming feeling
Leaves me numband strange
A sense of new beginning
I sense a wind of change

Out with the old useless
People so cold ruthless welcome
In a new millennium
How many times must I
Live out this nightmare I
Can't wait until a new millennium

I've got this feeling
The tide is turning now baby
Funny feeling everything's gonna be alright now

Living out a constant deja vu
Keep your head up
Please be patient we will get to you
Keep your head up
Just have some faith and you can see it
Through
Keep your head up
But faith don't pay the rent that's overdue
Keep your head up
All that's glittering is turning blue
Keep your head up
What they want from me ain't gotta clue
Keep your head up
Swallow pride before it swallows you
Keep your head up
Don't dare bite the hand that's starving you
Keep your head up

How can you keep your head
And not go insane when the only light at the end
Of the tunnel is another train

The lies ten feet tall
Have broken my fall
Welcome you all new millennium

It's well overdue and I can't wait to
Welcome in a new millennium
I've got this feeling
The tide is turning now baby
Funny feeling
Everything's gonna be alright now

"You Not Me"

Being round you is driving me crazy
Watching you run is making me lazy
You're trying to buy a place in my head
Telling me lines I've already read
Speaking my name to try to confuse me
Say it again you're starting to lose me

That's alright I'm okay
It happens every single day
It's all the same
But I'm not blind

It's all about you not me
It's all about the things
That you're expecting me to be
There's not enough time to live
And all that you're expecting me to give

It's all about you not me
It's all about you not me

You're building my prison brick by brick
Eating your words is making me sick
You get what you want
Cause nothing is sacred
You're reading my mind
And leaving me naked
You say I gotta give before I receive it
One of these days I'll believe it.

It's all about you not me
It's all about the things
That you're expecting me to be
There's not enough time to live
And all that you're expecting me to give

It's all about you not me
It's all about you not me

Wait, I hear it again
Don't turn on the lights until we
Hear the way it ends

The story unfolds in her eyes
Where midnight hysteria's
No big surprise
Battered and bruised
Always confusing
The love that she's losing for hate

Hey, I hope you know
I'm taking all of this time with me when I go
Shame, you're not to blame

Terror by night
Liar by day
Telling her secrets
Won't take them away

"Hollow Years"

He's just the kind of man
You hear about
Who leaves his family
For an easy out
They never saw the signs
He never said a word
He couldn't take another day

Carry me to the shoreline
Bury me in the sand
Walk me across the water
And maybe you'll understand

Once the stone
You're crawling under
Is lifted off your shoulders
Once the cloud that's raining
Over you head disappears
The noise that you'll hear
Is the crashing down of hollow years

She's not the kind of girl
You hear about
She'll never want another
She'll never be without
She'll give you all the signs
She'll tell you everything
Then turn around and walk away

Carry me to the shoreline
Bury me in the sand
Walk me across the water
And maybe you'll understand

Once the stone
You're crawling under
Is lifted off your shoulders
Once the cloud that's raining
Over you head disappears
The noise that you'll hear
Is the crashing down of hollow years

Carry me to the shoreline
Bury me in the sand
Walk me across the water
And maybe you'll understand

Once the stone
You're crawling under
Is lifted off your shoulders
Once the cloud that's raining
Over you head disappears
The noise that you'll hear
Is the crashing down of hollow years

"Burning My Soul"

A thorn in my side, a chip on my shoulder
A lump in my throat, the size of a boulder
The chill up my spine, can't get any colder
And you wonder why I can't smile

A knot in my gut, an ape on my back
In the heat of the moment, I'm knocked off the track
You drop the ball, I pick up the slack
And you ask me why my hairs gray

Twisting, turning
Losing all sense of yearning
Living and learning
The pressure keeps on burning my soul

I say it's green and then you tell me it's red
Keep your thoughts and ideas
Locked inside of your head
We've got someone
Who can think for you instead
And he sounds just like the last one

Twisting, turning
Losing all sense of yearning
Living and learning
The pressure keeps on burning my soul

Responsible thinkers
Throw caution to the wind
But I find myself
Speaking from within
I can't live my life
Walking on eggshells
To stay on your good side

Using your words
Controlling my life
Can't you see it's my words
That gives you your life
So I hurt your feelings
Well I'm really sorry
But I don't give a shit...

Twisting, turning
Losing all sense of yearning
Living and learning
The pressure keeps on burning my soul

"Lines In The Sand"

Sometimes, for a moment of bliss
And the passion, we're craving
There's a message we miss
Sometimes when the spirits left alone
We must believe in something
To find if we've grown

Tragic reflex, shattered calm
Static progress, senses gone
Numb awareness, final psalm

Swept away with the tide
Through the holes in my hands
Crown of thorns
At my side drawing lines in the sand

Sometimes, if you're perfectly still
You can hear the virgin weeping
For the savior of your will
Sometimes, your castles in the air
And the fantasies you're seeking

Are the crosses you bear

Sacred conflict, blessed prize
Weeping crosses, stainless eyes
Desperate addict, faith disguised

Swept away with the tide
Through the holes in my hands
Crown of thorns
At my side drawing lines in the sand

We fabricate our demons
Invite them into our homes
Have supper with the aliens
And fight the war alone
We conjure up our skeletons
Enlist the den of thieves
Frightened from our closets
Then sewn upon our sleeves

In the stream of consciousness
There is a river crying
Living comes much easier

Once we admit
We're dying

Sometimes, in the wreckage of our wake
There's a bitterness we harbor
And hate for hatred's sake
Sometime we dig an early grave
And crucify our instincts
For the hope we couldn't save

Sometimes a view from sinless eyes
Centers our perspective
And pacifies our cries
Sometimes the anguish we survive
And the mysteries we nurture
Are the fabrics of our lives

Swept away with the tide
Through the holes in my hands
Crown of thorns
At my side drawing lines in the sand

"Take Away My Pain"

I was sitting on the edge of his bed
Staring at the headlines on the paper
He said, "look at poor gene Kelly
I guess he won't be singing in the rain."
You can take away my heroes
Can you take away my pain

Take away my pain
Leave the cold outside
Please don't let it rain
Don't stumble on my pride
Take away my pain
I'm not frightened any more
Just stay with me tonight
I'm tired of this fight
Soon I'll be knocking at your door

She was standing by the edge of his bed
Staring at the message on their faces
He said, "what else can you do babe?
I guess I won't be coming home again."
They just took away all my promises
Make them take away my pain

Take away my pain
Leave the cold outside
Please don't let it rain
Don't stumble on my pride
Take away my pain
I'm not frightened any more
Just stay with me tonight
I'm tired of this fight
Soon I'll be knocking at your door

His final scene
The actor bows
And all those years
Are gone somehow
The crowd applauds
The curtain falls

I was standing by the edge of the water
I noticed my reflection in the waves
Then I saw you looking back at me
And I knew that for a moment
You were calling out my name
You took away my hero
Will you take away my pain

Take away my pain
Let the cold inside
It's time to let it rain
There's nothing left to hide
Take away my pain
I'm not frightened any more
I'm learning to survive
Without you in my life
Til you come knocking at my door.......

"Just Let Me Breathe"

Open your eyes
And turn off your mind
Step right up folks and you will find
Agrowing trend
An epidemic
Spread with zen
And hypodermics

Just close your mind
You can find all you need with your eyes

The big machines take care of
You until you kill yourself
And then the sales go through the roof
Calculated, formulated
Feed my head with simple thoughts
And let me breathe instead of being taught
All bottled up and tearing at the seams
I'm bored
Just let me breathe

A daily dose of eMpTyV
Will flush your mind right down the drain
Shannon Hoon and Kurt Cobain,
Make yourself a household name

Just close your mind
You can find all you need with your eyes

The big machines take care of you
Until you kill yourself
And then the sales go through the roof
Calculated, formulated
Feed my head with simple thoughts
And let me breathe instead of being taught
All bottled up and tearing at the seams
I'm bored
Just let me breathe

Strike up your best angst ridden posture
Manufactured anger
Let's not forget my legacy
All my heroes have failed me
Now they're dead and buried

Just close your mind
You can find all you need with your eyes

The big machines will take care of you
Until the fashion fades
And the checks go through
My bank roll's red and my face is blue
And still they'll turn their backs on you for
Someone new

Feed my head
With some real thoughts
And let me think instead
Of being taught
I'll say things
You won't believe
Just stand back
Just let me breathe.......

"Anna Lee"

Helpless child
They invite your hands to fill their needs
Will you be the same
Shameless smile
To steal from you the innocence that bleeds
Will they feel your pain

Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone

She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't wanna be alone where do you belong
Anna lee

Behind those eyes
The vivid scene
A lucid dream within
Questioned secrets are revealed
And everytime
You can't deny
The lines that trace your skin
Wounds that never heal

Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone

She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't wanna be alone where do you belong
Anna Lee

And now she's calling out a name
Can't keep on hiding all her pain
You feel the rain move in
As you begin
To turn and answer the call

Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone

She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't wanna be alone where do you belong

"Trial Of Tears"

[I. IT'S RAINING]

Under the sun, there is nothing to hide
Under the moon, the stranger waits inside
People disappear
The music fades away
Splashing through the rain
I'll dream with them one day
It's raining, raining,
On the streets of New York city
It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven

I may have wasted all those years
They're not worth their time in tears
I may have spent too long in darkness
In the warmth of my fears

Take a look at yourself
Not at anyone else
And tell me what you see
I know the air is cold
I know the streets are cruel
But I'll enjoy the ride today

It's raining, raining,
On the streets of New York city
It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven

I may have wasted all those years
They're not worth their time in tears
I may have spent too long in darkness
In the warmth of my fears

As I walk through all my myths
Rising and sinking like the waves
With my thoughts wrapped around me
Through a trial of tears

Hidden by disguise, stumbling in a world
Feeling uninspired, he gets into his car
Not within his eyes to see, open up, open up
Not much better than the man you hate

[II. DEEP IN HEAVEN]

[Instrumental]

[III. THE WASTELAND]

Still awake
I continue to move along
Cultivating my own nonsense
Welcome to the wasteland
Where you'll find ashes, nothing but ashes
Still awake
Bringing change, bringing movement,
Bringing life
A silent prayer thrown away,
Disappearing in the air
Rising, sinking, raining deep inside me
Nowhere to turn,
I look for a way back home
It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven

"A Change Of Seasons"

[I. The Crimson Sunrise]

[Instrumental]

[II. Innocence]

I remember a time
My frail, virgin mind
Watched the crimson sunrise
Imagined what it might find
Life was filled with wonder
I felt the warm wind blow
I must explore the boundaries
Transcend the depth of winter's snow

Innocence caressing me
I never felt so young before
There was so much life in me
Still I longed to search for more

But those days are gone now
Changed like a leaf on a tree
Blown away forever
Into the cool autumn breeze
The snow has now fallen
And my sun's not so bright
I struggle to hold on
With the last of my might

In my den of inequity
Viciousness and subtlety
Struggle to ease the pain
Struggle to find the same

Ignorance surrounding me
I've never been so filled with fear
All my life's been drained from me
The end is drawing near...

[III. Carpe Diem]

"Carpe diem
Seize the day"

I'll always remember
The chill of November
The news of the fall
The sounds in the hall
The clock on the wall
Ticking away
"Seize the Day"
I heard him say
Life will not always be this way
Look around
Hear the sounds
Cherish your life
While you're still around

("Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
(Old Time is still a-flying;)
(And this same flower that smiles today)
(Tomorrow will be dying")

We can learn
From the past
But those days
Are gone
We can hope
For the future
But there might not be one

The words stuck in my mind
Alive from what I've learned
I have to seize the day
To home I returned

Preparing for her flight
I held with all my might
Fearing my deepest fright
She walked into the night
She turned for one last look
She looked me in the eye
I said, "I Love You...
Good-bye"

("It's the most awful thing you'll ever hear")
("If you're lying to me...")
("Oh, you dearly love her")
("...just have to leave...)
(All our lives")
("Seize the day!")
("Something happened")
("Gather ye rosebuds while ye may")
("She was killed")

[IV. The Darkest Of Winters]

[Instrumental]

[V. Another World]

So far or so it seems
All is lost
With nothing fulfilled
Off the pages and the
T.V. screen
Another world
Where nothing's true

Tripping through
The life fantastic
Lose a step
And never get up
Left alone
With a cold blank stare
I feel like giving up

I was blinded by a paradise
Utopia high in the sky
A dream that only drowned me
Deep in sorrow, wondering why

Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what
Don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Then string him up for all the world to see

I'm sick of all
Your hypocrites
Holding me at bay
And I don't need
Your sympathy
To get me through the day

Seasons change and so can I
Hold on Boy
No time to cry
Untie these strings
I'm climbing down
I won't let them push me away

Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what
Don't let him be
Let's feed upon
His misery
Now it's time for them
To deal with me

[VI. The Inevitable Summer]

[Instrumental]

[VII. The Crimson Sunset]

I'm much wiser now
A lifetime of memories
Run through my head
They taught me how
For better or worse
Alive or dead
I realize
There's no turning back
Life goes on
The offbeaten track

I sit down with my son
Set to see the Crimson Sunset
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
Many years have come and gone
I've lived my life, but now must move on
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
He's my only one
Now that my time has come
Now that my life is done
We look into the sun
"Seize the day
And don't you cry
Now it's time
To say good-bye
Even though
I'll be gone
I will live on
Live on"

"Funeral For A Friend / Love Lies Bleeding"

The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house
Is gonna grow and die

Oh it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said I'm sorry honey
If I don't change the pace
I can't face another day

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through

You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
While if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

Oooooh oooh
Oooooh
Oh oh oh oh ooh
Love lies bleeding in my hands
Oooh
Oooh ooh

"Perfect Strangers"

Can you remember
Remember my name
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Ooooh and cold
Cold spirits of ice (ice ice)
All my life
I am the echo of your past

I am returning
The echo of a point in time
In distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
Ooooh and laughing
As the spirits appear
Ooooh all your life
Shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers

Oooooh ooh

I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow
Oh

A strand of silver
Hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind
Ooooh is aching
With the dead of the night
Precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers

"The Rover / Achilles Last Stand / The Song Remains The Same"

[I. The Rover]

[Instrumental]

[II. Achilles Last Stand]

It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turn to you you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Woah the songs to sing
When we at last return again yeah
Oh
Oh

Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
To know the streets the seaman hears
The devil in his hole
Oh to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah
Oh
Ooh

Into the sun the south the north
Lies the first of hope
Shackles of commitment fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd yeah
Oh oooh

To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
With guidance from the curving path
That churns up into stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah
Ooooh

Oh

[III. The Song Remains The Same]

Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah
Here we go
Wanted to know, oh oh
Sing out Hare, Hare, oh
Dance the Hoochie Koo
The city lights
Oh so bright
As we go sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding
Through
Oooh
All right

[I. In The Flesh?]

So 'ya
Thought 'ya
Might like to
Go to the show

To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind this cold eyes?
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise

Lights...
Roll the sound effects...
Action...
Shout out! (shout out)

[III. Bohemian Rhapsody]

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby
Can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here

[IV. Loving, Touching, Squeezing]

You make me weep
And wanna die
Just when
You said we'd try
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other

When I'm alone
Oh by myself
You're out
With someone else
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other

You're tearin' me apart
Every day, every day
You're tearin' me apart
Oh what can I say?
You're tearin' me apart

It won't be long, no
Until you're alone
When you're lover
Oh he hasn't come home
'Cause he's lovin', oh he's touchin', he's squeezin'
Another

He's tearin' you apart
Every day, every day
He's tearin' you apart
Oh girl what can you say?
'Cause he's lovin', touchin', another
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry

"6:00"

[Samples from the film "The Dead", an adaptation of James Joyce's short story from his book]
"Six o'clock on a Christmas morning..."
"And for what?"
"Well, isn't it for the honor of God, Aunt Kate?"
"I know all about the honor of God, Mary Jane."

Six o'clock the siren kicks him from a dream
Tries to shake it off but it just won't stop
Can't find the strength but he's got promises to keep
And wood to chop before he sleeps

I may never get over
but never's better than now
I've got bases to cover

He's in the parking lot and he's just sitting in his car
It's nine o'clock but he can't get out
He lights a cigarette
and turns the music down
but just can't seem to shake that sound

Once I thought I'd get over
but it's too late for me now
I've got bases to cover

Melody walks through the door
and memory flies out the window
and nobody knows what they want
'til they finally let it all go

The pain inside
coming outside

So many ways to drown a man
So many ways to drag him down
Some are fast and some take years and years
Can't hear what he's saying when he's talking in his sleep
He finally found the sound but he's in too deep

I could never get over
Is it too late for me now?
Feel like blowing my cover

Melody walks through the door
and memory flies out the window
and nobody knows what they want
'til they finally let it all go

But don't cut your losses too soon
'cause you'll only be cutting your throat
And answer a call while you still hear at all
'cause nobody will if you won't

[Samples from the film "The Dead", an adaptation of James Joyce's short story from his book]

"Caught In A Web"

Silence disguised
I watch you
Show me the hurt
that haunts you
would you despise the thrill
If all you hide were mine?

I can't hold on any longer
These feelings keep growing stronger
Echoes that deafen the mind
will bury my voice in their wake

Caught in a Web
Removed from the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning the lies
devised in my head
Caught in a Web refused by the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning a cage denied and misread

I've seen the path
the one you take
shows the truth
for you to make
This turn of phrase
we might not see
is the thirst of desire
found so easily

Try to push me 'round
the world some more
And make me live in fear
I bare all that I am
made of now
Attractive I don't care
'Cause even when I danced with life
no one was there to share

Does this voice the wounds of your soul?
Does this voice the wounds of your soul?

Caught in a Web
Removed from the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning the lies
devised in my head

Tried to live the life
you live and saw
It doesn't work for me
I bare all that I am
made of now
Attractive, I can't be
Inside the Dance of Life is one
I'll never hold to me

You can't heal the wounds of my soul.
You can't heal the wounds of my soul.

Caught in a Web
Removed from the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning the lies
devised in my head

Caught in a Web
Refused by the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning a cage
Denied and misread

"Innocence Faded"

Animation
breathes a cloudless mind
Fascination
leaves the doubting blind
Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead
the faithful live Awake
the rest remain misled

Some will transcend spinning years
One as if time disappears

Innocence faded
the mirror falls behind you
Trinity jaded
I break down walls to find you

Callow and vain
fixed like a fossil, shrouding pain
Passionless stage
Distant like brothers
Wearing apathetic displays
Sharing flesh like envy in cages
Condescending
Not intending to end

Some will transcend spinning years
One as if time disappears

Innocence faded
the mirror falls behind you
Trinity jaded
I break down walls to find you

Beginnings get complicated
the farther we progress
Opinions are calculated
Immune to openness

Beyond the circle's edge
We're driven by her blessings
Forever hesitating
Caught beneath the wheel

Innocence faded
the mirror falls behind you
Cynically jaded
The child will crawl to find you.

"Voices"

'Love, just don't stare'
He used to say to me
every Sunday morning
The spider in the window
The angel in the pool
The old man takes the poison
Now the widow makes the rules

'So speak, I'm right here'
She used to say to me
not a word, not a word
Judas on the ceiling
the Devil in my bed
I guess Easter's never coming
So I'll just wait inside my head

Like a scream but sort of silent
living off my nightmares

Voices repeating me
'Feeling threatened?
We reflect your hopes and fears.'
Voices discussing me
'Others steal your thoughts
they're not confined
within your mind.'

Thought disorder
Dream control
Now they read my mind on the radio
But where was the Garden of Eden?

I feel elated
I feel depressed
Sex is death, Death is sex
Says it right here on my Crucifix

Like a scream but sort of silent
living off my nightmares

Voices protecting me
'Good behavior
brings the Savior
to his knees.'
Voices rejecting me
'Others steal your thoughts
they're not confined
to your own mind.'

[Dialogue by rap artist Prix-mo reading from the book "Cultural Revolution".]
"I don't wanna be here, 'cause of my
suffering, 'cause of my illness.
Only love is worth having, only
love is what matters, loving every
people on equal terms. "
"You've got to know who you're
dealin' with because, like a stranger,
a-heh, just might come in through
here with a gun... and then, what
would you do? (Heh.)"
"Everything is immaterial..."
"'n' you know that reality is immaterial."
"This is not reality..."

I'm kneeling on the floor
staring at the wall
like the spider in the window
I wish that I could speak
Is there fantasy in refuge?
God in politicians?
Should I turn on my religion?
These demons in my head tell me to

I'm lying here in bed
Swear my skin is inside out
Just another Sunday morning

Seen my diary on the newsstand
Seems we've lost the truth to quicksand
It's a shame no one is praying
'Cause these voices in my head
keep saying...

'Love, just don't stare.'
'Reveal the Word when you're
supposed to'
Withdrawn and introverted
Infectiously perverted
'Being laughed at and confused
keeps us pleasantly amused
enough to stay.'

Maybe I'm just Cassandra fleeting
Twentieth century Icon bleeding
Willing to risk Salvation
to escape from isolation

I'm witness to redemption
heard you speak but never listened
Can you rid me of my secrets?
Deliver us from Darkness?

Voices repeating me
'Feeling threatened?
We reflect your hopes and fears.'
Voices discussing me
Don't expect your own Messiah
This neverworld which you desire
is only in your mind.

"The Silent Man"

A question well served,
'Is silence like a fever?'
'A voice never heard?'
'Or a message with no receiver?'

Pray they won't ask
Behind the stained glass
There's always one more mask

Has man been a victim
of his woman, of his father?
if he elects not to bother,
will he suffocate their faith?

Desperate to fall
Behind the Great Wall
That separates us all

When there is reason
Tonight I'm Awake
when there's no answer
Arrive the Silent Man

If there is balance
tonight He's Awake
If they have to suffer
There lies the Silent Man

Sin without deceivers
A God with no believers
I could sail by
on the Winds of Silence
And maybe they won't notice
But this time I think
It'd be better if I swim

When there is reason
Tonight I'm Awake
When there's no answer
Arrive the Silent Man
If there is balance
Tonight he's Awake
But if they have to suffer
There lies the Silent Man

"The Mirror"

Temptation-
Why won't you leave me alone?
Lurking Every Corner, everywhere I go

Self Control-
Don't turn your back on me now
When I need you the most

Constant pressure tests my will
My will or my won't
My Self Control escapes from me still...

Hypocrite-
How could you be so cruel
and expect my faith in return?

Resistance-
Is not as hard as it seems
When you close the door

I spent so long trusting in you
I trust you forgot
Just when I thought I believed in you...

[Sample is Meryl Streep from the film "Falling In Love".]
"What're you doing?
What're you doing?"

It's time for me to deal
Becoming all too real
living in fear-
Why did you lie and pretend?
This has come to an end
I'll never trust you again
It's time you made your amends
Look in the mirror my friend

[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".]
"That I haven't behaved as I should"
[Sample is Mary Beth Hurt from the film "Light Sleeper".]
"Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you."
[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".]
"I thought you could control life, but it's not like that. There are things you can't control."

Let's stare the problem right in the eye
It's plagued me from coast to coast
Racing the clock to please everyone
All but the one who matters the most

Reflections of reality
are slowly coming into view
How in the hell could you possibly forgive me?
After all the hell I put you through

It's time for me to deal
Becoming all too real
living in fear-
Why'd I betray my friend?
Lying until the end
Living life so pretend
It's time to make my amends
I'll never hurt you again

"Lie"

Daybreak
at the bottom of lake
it's a hundred degrees I can't breathe
And I won't get out
'til I figure it out
Though I'm weak like I can't believe
So you tell me 'trust me' l can trust you
Just let me show you
But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt
'cause I don't know if I know you

Doing fine but don't waste my time
Tell me what it is you want to say
You sin, you win, just let me in - hurry
I've been out in the rain all day
So you tell me 'trust me' I can trust you
as far as I can throw you
And I'm trying to get out of a shadow of doubt
'cause I don't know if I know you

Don't tell me you wanted me
Don't tell me you thought of me
I won't, I swear I won't
(Did)
I'll try, I swear I'll try
(Lie)

Mother Mary quite contrary
Kiss the boys and make them wary
Things are getting just a little bit scary
It's a wonder I can still breathe

Never been much of a doubting Thomas
but nothing breaks like a broken promise
You tell me 'bout your two more coming
but once is just enough for me

Don't tell me you wanted me
Don't tell me you thought of me
I won't, I swear I won't (did)
I'll try, I swear I'll try (lie)

I had gotten used to being a soul destroyed
She comes in apparently to fill the void
All dogs need a leash and
at least I'll forget it
And she would never hurt me though
she's never said it
But I'm not gonna ask her today
I don't wanna scare her away
Your town, I'm all alone
and I just can't stare at the phone
I wanna talk about lifelong mistakes
and you can tell your stepfather I said so

"Lifting Shadows Off A Dream"

He seems alone and silent
thoughts remain without an answer
Afraid and uninvited
he slowly drifts away

Moved by desire and fear
Breaking delicate wings

Lifting shadows
off a Dream once broken
She can turn a drop of water
Into an ocean

As the rain is pouring down
Tears of sorrow wash his mind
Drifting with the current
This stream of life flows on

He seems alone and silent
waiting on his hands and knees
The chill of winter's darkness sits quietly

Moved by desire and fear
he takes a few steps away

Lifting shadows
off a Dream once broken
She can turn a drop of water
Into an ocean

And she listens openly

He pours his soul into the water
reflecting the mystery
She carries him away
and the winds die slowly

And she listens openly
And she listens openly

Lifting shadows
off a Dream once broken
She can turn a drop of water
Into an ocean

Lifting Shadows off a Dream
Lifting Shadows off a Dream

"Scarred"

To Rise, To Fall.
To Hurt, To Hate.
To Want, To Wait.
To Heal, To Save.

Can't hear it
we fear it
awareness won't come near it

Distractive
Reactive
Disguised in spite of time

I never bared my emotion
My passion always strong
I never lost my devotion
but somewhere fate went wrong

Can't let them rape me again
Your venom's not family here
won't let them fill me with
fatalistic remedies

What if the rest of the world
was hopelessly blinded by fear?
Where would my sanctity live?
Suddenly nobody cares.

It's never enough
You're wasting your time
Isn't there something I could say?
You don't understand
You're closing me out
How can we live our lives this way?

You tell me I'm wrong
I'm risking my life
Still, I have nothing in return
I show you my hands
You don't see the scars
Maybe you'll leave me here to burn.

What if the rest of the world
was hopelessly drowning in vain?
Where would our self pity run?
Suddenly everyone cares.

Blood...Heal me
Fear...Change me
Belief will always save me
Blood...Swearing
Fear...Staring
Conviction made aware

Give up on misery
Turn your back on dissent
Leave their distrust behind
Wash your hands of regret

Do you feel you don't know me anymore?
And do you feel I'm afraid of your love?
And how come you don't want me asking?
And how come my heart's not invited?
You say you want everyone happy
Well, we're not laughing.

And how come you don't understand me?
And how come I don't understand you?
Thirty years say we're in this together
So open your eyes.

People in prayer for me
everyone there for me
Sometimes I feel I should face this alone
My soul exposed
It calms me to know that I won't

Blood...Heal me
Fear...Change me
Belief will always save me
Blood...Swearing
Fear...Staring
Conviction made aware

Give up on misery
Turn your back on dissent
Leave their distrust behind
Wash your hands of regret

Blood...Heal me
Fear...Change me
Belief will always save me
Blood...Swearing
Fear...Staring
Conviction made aware

Learning from misery
Staring back at dissent
Leaving distrust behind
I'm inspired and content

"Space-Dye Vest"

Falling through pages of Martens on angels
Feeling my heart pull west
I saw the future dressed as a stranger
love in a space-dye vest

Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding
a pool in the shape of a heart
Beauty projection in the reflection
Always the worst way to start

[Sample is Julian Sands from the film "A Room With A View".]
"But he's the sort who can't know
anyone intimately, least of all a
woman. He doesn't know what a woman
is. He wants you for a possession,
something to look at like a painting or an ivory box.
Something to own and to display. He doesn't want you to be real,
or to think or to live. He doesn't love you, but I love you.
I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and
feelings, even when
I hold you in my arms. It's our last chance... It's our
last chance..."

Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it
Learning to swallow the rage
Found a new girl I think we can make it
as long as she stays on the page

This is not how I want it to end
And I'll never be open again

[Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".]
"...I was gonna move out...ummm...get,
get a job, get my own place, ummm,
but... I go into the mall where I
want to work and they tell me, I'm,
I was too young..."

[Sample is Jim Hill from a news commentary about the OJ Simpson freeway chase.]
"Some people, gave advice before,
about facing the facts, about
facing reality. And this is, this
without a doubt, is his biggest
challenge ever. He's going to have to face it.
You're gonna have to try, he's gonna to have to try and,
uh, and, and, and get some help here. I mean no one can
say they know how he feels."

[Sample from the Conan O'Brien show.]
"That, so they say that, in ya know
like, Houston or something, you'd
say it's a hundred and eighty degrees,
but it's a dry heat.
In Houston they say that?
Oh, maybe not. I'm all mixed up.
Dry until they hit the swimming pool."

[Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".]
"...I get up with the sun... Listen.
You have your own room to sleep in,
I don't care what you do. I don't
care when. That door gets locked,
that door gets locked at night by nine o'clock.
If you're not in this house by nine o'clock, then you'd
better find some
place to sleep. Because you're not going to be a bum in
this house.
Supper is ready..."

There's no one to take my blame
if they wanted to
There's nothing to keep me sane
and it's all the same to you
There's nowhere to set my aim
so I'm everywhere
Never come near me again
do you really think I need you

I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.
I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.

And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend
And I'll never be open again
And I'll have no more dreams to defend
And I'll never be open again

"Pull Me Under"

Lost in the sky
Clouds roll by
and I roll with them
Arrows fly
Seas increase
and then fall again

This world is spinning around me
This world is spinning without me
Every day send future to past
Every breath leaves me one less
to my last

Watch the sparrow falling
Gives new meaning to it all
If not today nor yet tomorrow
then some other day

I'll take seven lives for one
And then my only father's son
As sure as I did ever love him
I am not afraid

This world is spinning around me
The whole world keeps
spinning around me
All life is future to past
Every breath leaves me one less
to my last

Pull me under Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is set it right

Dust fills my eyes
Clouds roll by
and I roll with them
Centuries cry
Orders fly
and I fall again

This world is spinning inside me
The whole world is
spinning inside of me
Every day sends future to past
Every step brings me closer
to my last

Pull me under Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
Living my life too much in
the sun
Only until your will is done

"Another Day"

Live another day
Climb a little higher
Find another reason to stay
Ashes in your hands
Mercy in your eyes
If you're searching for a silent
sky...

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So die another day

The coldness of this words
The message in his silence,
"Face the candle to the
wind..."
This distance in my voice
Isn't leaving you a choice
So if you're looking for a time
to run away...

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So try another day

They took pictures of our
dreams
Ran to hide behind the stairs
And said maybe when it's right
for you, they'll fall
But if they don't come down
Resist the need to pull them in
And throw them away
Better to save the mystery
Than surrender to the secret

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So try another day

"Take The Time"

Just let me catch my breath...
I've heard the promises
I've seen the mistakes
I've had my fair share of tough breaks
I need a new voice, a new law, a new way
Take the time, reevaluate
It's time to pick up the pieces,
Go back to square one
I think it's time for a change

There is something that I feel
To be something that is real
I feel the heat within my mind
And craft new changes with my eyes
Giving freely wandering promises
A place with decisions I'll fashion
I won't waste another breath

You can feel the waves coming on
(It's time to take the time)
Let them destroy you or carry you on
(It's time to take the time)
You're fighting the weight of the world
But no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind

The unbroken spirit
Obscured and disquiet
Finds clearness this trial demands
And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief
For the fortune lies still in his hands

If there's pensive fear, a wasted year
A man must learn to cope
If his obsession's real,
Suppression that he feels must turn to hope

Life is no more assuring than love
(It's time to take the time)
There are no answers from voices above
(It's time to take the time)
You're fighting the weight of the world
And no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind

I close my eyes
And feel the water rise around me
Drown the bead of time
Let my senses fall away
I can see much clearer now,
I'm blind

You can feel the waves coming on
(It's time to take the time)
Let them destroy you or carry you on
(It's time to take the time)
You're fighting the weight of the world
But no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind

Find all you need in your mind
If you take the time
Find all you need in your mind
If you take the time

"Surrounded"

Morning comes too early
and nighttime falls too late
And sometimes all I want to do
is wait
The shadow I've been hiding in
has fled from me today

I know it's easier to walk away
than look it in the eye
But I will raise a shelter to the sky
and here beneath this
star tonight I'll lie
She will slowly yield the light
As I awaken from the longest
night

Dreams are shaking
Set sirens waking up tired eyes
With the light the memories
all rush into his head

By a candle stands a mirror
Of his heart and soul she
dances
She was dancing thru the night
above his bed

And walking to the window
he throws the shutters out
against the wall
And from an ivory tower hears
her call
"Let light surround you"

It's been a long, long time
He's had a while to think it over
In the end he only sees the
change
Light to dark
Dark to light
Light to dark
Dark to light

Heaven must be more than this
When angels waken with a kiss
Sacred hearts won't take the
pain
But mine will never be the same

He stands before the window
His shadow slowly fading from
the wall
And from an ivory tower hears
her call
"Let the light surround you"

Once lost but I was found
When I heard the stained glass
shatter all around me
I sent the spirits tumbling
down the hill
But I will hold this one on high
above me still
She whispers words to clear my mind
I once could see but now at last
I'm blind

I know it's easier to walk away
than look it in the eye
But I had given all that
I could take
And now I've only habits left
to break
Tonight I'll still be lying here
Surrounded in all the light

"Metropolis - Part I - "The Miracle And The Sleeper""

The smile of dawn arrived early May she carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear to tell her of fear and of sorrow and pain she'll never outgrow
Death is the first dance, eternal

There's no more freedom
The both of you will be confined to this mind

I was told there's miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire
As a child, I thought I could live without pain without sorrow
As a man I've found it's all caught up with me I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid

Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
Eluding stares from faces before me
It hides away and will never be heard of again
Deceit is the second without end
The city's cold blood teaches us to survive
Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive the third arrives

Before the leaves have fallen before we lock the doors there must be the third and last dance
This one will last forever Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles she's taken you to your home
It can only take place when the struggle between our children has ended
Now the Miracle and the Sleeper know that the third is love Love is the Dance of Eternity

"Under A Glass Moon"

Tell me
Remind me
Chase the water racing from
the sky
Always beside me
Taste the memories running
from my eyes
Nervous flashlights scan my
dreams
Liquid shadows silence their
screams
I smile at the moon
Chasing water from the sky
I argue with the clouds
Stealing beauty from my eyes

Outside the soundness of your
mind
Bathing your soul in silver tears
Beneath a blackened summer sky
Praying for time to disappear

Beneath a summer sky
Under glass moonlight
Night awaits the lamb's arrival
Liquid shadows crawl
Silver teardrops fall
The bride subsides to her
survival

By your hand
I've awakened
Bear this honor in my name

<|endoftext|>

"Wait For Sleep"

Standing by the window
Eyes upon the moon
Hoping that the memory
will leave his spirit soon

She shuts the doors and lights
And lays her body on the bed
Where images and words are
running deep
She has too much pride to pull
the sheets above her head
So quietly she lays and waits
for sleep

She stares at the ceiling
And tries not to think
And pictures the chains
She's been trying to link again
But the feeling is gone

And water can't cover her
memory
And ashes can't answer her
pain
God give me the power to take
breath from a breeze
And call life from a cold metal
frame

In with the ashes
Or up with the smoke from the
fire
With wings up in heaven
Or here, lying in bed
Palm of her hand to my head
Now and forever curled in my
heart
And the heart of the world

"Learning To Live"

There was no time for pain
No energy for anger
The sightlessness of hatred
slips away
Walking through winter streets
alone
He stops and take a breath
With confidence and self-
control

I look at the world and see no
understanding
I'm waiting to find some sense
of strength
I'm begging you from the
bottom of my heart to show
me understanding

I need to live life
Like some people never will
So find me kindness
Find me beauty
Find me truth
When temptation brings me to
my knees
And I lay here drained of
strength
Show me kindness
Show me beauty
Show me truth

The way your heart sounds
makes all the difference
It's what decides if you'll endure
the pain that we all feel
The way your heart beats
makes all the difference
In learning to live
Here before me is my soul
I'm learning to live
I won't give up
Till I've no more to give

Listening to the city
Whispering its violence
I set out watching from above
The 90s bring new questions
New solutions to be found
I fell in love to be let down

Once again we dance in the
crowd
At times a step away
From a common fear that's all
spread out
It won't listen to what you say
Once you're touched you stand
alone
To face the bitter fight
Once I reached for love
And now I reach for life

Another chance to lift my life
Free the sensation in my heart
To ride the wings of dreams
into changing horizons
It brings inner peace within my
mind,
As I'm lifted from where I've
spilt my life
I hear an innocent voice
I hear kindness, beauty and
truth

The way your heart sounds
makes all the difference
It's what decides if you'll endure
the pain that we all feel
The way your heart beats
makes all the difference
In learning to live
Spread before you is your soul
So forever hold the dreams
within our hearts
Through nature's inflexible
grace
I'm learning to live

"A Fortune In Lies"

"For the first time in a long time
...everything was right in my
world... and then I woke up."

I can remember when,
In the unity of our five-day sessions
Not even once did we hear the siren
song
What kind of imagination
Asleep in some lyrical coma
Who's vain futile memory
Could have been so wrong?

You can make a fortune in lies
You can keep a giant alive
You can ride the red
Until everybody smiles
A trifling euphoria
was such an untimely religion
maybe your life can explain
the reason for my indecision
Here is a poor man
the heart of this monster creation
He said we both will be heroes
and I was led into temptation

You can make a fortune in lies
You can keep a giant alive
You can ride the red
Until everybody smiles

Can you show me your gold
and your silver?
A hero in frozen water

Now you've made a fortune in lies
and you kept a giant alive
You rode the red
You rode the red

"Status Seeker"

Heart sick at the sight of the
Status Seeker
In a sense I'm not beyond reproach
the aspiration to drop a name
When any rose might smell the same
Maybe you'll figure it out someday
"I want to know you now...
You know I've always believed in you."

Nothing is sacred...
You draw the bottom line
with a dollar sign
Change of opinion...
At the drop of a dime
Graceless intrusion...
Are you sanctified in your
judgment of me?
All that I deserve is what you were
unable to see

In a garden where the seeds were
spilled
I favored the few that stood strong
in the sun
As I reached for the profit of my prize
I found I had trampled the forgotten
ones

Nothing is sacred...
You draw the bottom line
with a dollar sign
Change of opinion...
At the drop of a dime
Graceless intrusion...
Are you sanctified in your
judgment of me?
All that I deserve is what you were
unable to see

You're running in circles
And I'm turning away
You refused to believe
Now I'm turning away

Nothing is sacred...
You draw the bottom line

At the drop of a dime

"The Killing Hand"

[I. The Observance]
An Angel's kiss now fallen
Descending scarlet cuts the sky
Faded names left on the wall
Honor the fighting leave life to
die

Remembered is the sacrifice but
No praisal of blood still flowing
Who were the leaders?
what controlled the Killing Hand
that caused this mouthing?

Crossing over...

[II. Ancient Renewal]
Lowered deep into the sea
Being a waits to cleanse his soul
senses weakening time is still
Motionless by stiffening cold

The wheels race back and
Scorch his mind
Travelling all to find the land
Revelation warms a touch
And now he will begin to
Understand

[III. The Stray Seed]
Extended a view to yesterday
Manifestation for none the same
Walking amidst a frightening still
No sound, no smoke, no scorching
Flames

He is risen...

Sipping his poison the raven sings
Yet another to add more bodies
fallen
King from below
this one controls
the Killing Hand that caused this
mourning

Is it all over?

[IV. Thorns]
Evil genius this secret plan
Mercy dealt with the losing hand
Will he ever fall?
Can he end it all?
Our savior must make his stand

Only a Propher of years to come
Wanting mortality I'm all alone
He heard my voice
It was my choice
I've stopped the Killing Hand

[V. Exodus]
When I go back again
Will it be the same?
I've stopped the cries
But now they know my name

The sea is calling me
my spirit must return
As I get closer,
was it really worth
what I have learned?

I'm in the valley
And the saddened chimes I hear
Race towards the wall to find
one more name appears

No one is left now
my one and only land
I laugh at what I've done
I am the Killing Hand

"Light Fuse And Get Away"

Would you like to sit and talk to me
about the way things change so
suddenly
when your senses come and the feeling
goes?
can you remember feeling much
too close?

Stop your hands from shaking.
Look at me.
Are your senses racing endlessly
tracing
past impressions? So were mine.
Have you ever been used
or will this be the first time?

It's come so clear to me
Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
It's a fatal game
and the true lose everything

I can see
what trust and loyalty have done
for me
falling miles from the mark
with a thirst for revenge
and a dangerous heart

I've tried to wash from memory
feelings of betrayal and the incidents
that plague me since I lost my sense
of innocence

A history of changes now I'm loving
now I'm losing keeps me constantly
in fear of hearing "I can't see where
this is going"

You lie alone with the memory
feeling the ceiling and walls closing
in on
Your Conscience - my ally
the guilt - your affliction
from preying on praise as you fed
an attention addiction

Someone told me
Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
and when it's lust to dust you can
crawl from the wreckage

I can see
what trust and loyalty have done
for me
lying bleeding in the dark
with a thirst for revenge
and a dangerous heart

It's come so clear to me
Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
It's a fatal game
and the true lose everything

I can see
what trust and loyalty have done
for me
falling miles from the mark
with a thirst for revenge
and a dangerous heart

"Afterlife"

I touched with one
who made me run
away from my own soul...
In this world with its
many illusions
We are moving like mice through a
maze

And now I find
what's left behind
has served to make me whole
full of doubt, deception, and delusion
seeking purpose to all earthly days

I search within
beneath a skin
that bears both pleasure and pain
In a world full of constant confusion
I will not be a par to the craze

In the Afterlife
will dark be bright?
will cold be warm?
will the day have no night?
In the Afterlife?
will the blind have sight?
In the Afterlife

Behind closed eyes
some comfort lies
In knowing the truth never spoken
Through this world with us
hidden conclusion
we'll keep moving like mice through
a maze

In the Afterlife
will dark be bright?
will cold be warm?
will the day have no night?
In the Afterlife?
will the blind have sight?
In the Afterlife

In the Afterlife
will dark be bright?
will cold be warm?
will the day have no night?
In the Afterlife?
will the blind have sight?
In the Afterlife

"The Ones Who Help To Set The Sun"

Watching my window I was led like a
child
As the roadway lamplights
misguided my mind through the night
a shadow of limits
We were racing the rain
my hands held the wheel
My eyes tried to hold their place

there must have been a time
when I thought that you were
watching
It had to be when my senses lost
control
I thought I'd slipped away
I thought I could still feel us
moving
It must have been a cloud
no bigger than a man's hand

Every reason I risk my life
To come back to you
Is locked behind your door
You're my immunity
Outside I watched you burn
Heavy hearts were bleeding
A cry for help, a familiar voice
My melting hands streaked the glass

As I walked away
I wondered what had really
happened
had I run out of time
did I push myself too far
As my last step fell
I felt my hands upon the wheel
had I come back to life
or did I ever leave at all

In higher lives
We seem to be
always a moment too late
We're past the time
when we looked on
Now we're
THE ONES WHO HELP TO
SET THE SUN
this time for real
I locked the door behind me
My mind was still a wreck
from what I saw
For when my hands are still
I'll recognize the message
never again will my senses lose
control
In higher lives
We seem to be
Always a moment too late
We're past the time
when we looked on
Now we're
THE ONES WHO HELP TO
SET THE SUN

"Only A Matter Of Time"

A suited man smiled said:
"It's just a matter of time
You can have the world at your feet
by tomorrow
just sign on this line."
Hold tight... limelight!
Approaching the paramount
with the sun in our eyes
fearing family ties, legalies,
compromise

In a dimly lit room with a stool as his
stage
a dream-stricken prince of a pauper's
descent
haunts the eavesdropping silence
that presses his window
as he sweats a performance
to an audience that ticks on the wall

To the practical observer
It's just a matter of time
"You can deviate from the com-
monplace
only to fall back in line."
I understand mine's a risky plan
and your system can't miss
But is security after all a cause
or symptom of happiness?

Brave, yet afraid, his eyes on horizon
in a steady-set gaze
a mariner soon from an open cocoon
takes a moment to summon his courage
to stifle his grave apprehension and
trembling, approaches the surf
A father's benediction as his hopeful
son departs
to brave the sea of rage and conquer
at all costs

lingers in his memory
and visions still surviving in a logic-
proof shell
that should have been held sacred, safe
and hidden well
are compromised in usury
with every rising sun that yields no
sight of land
the hesitation cultivates within the
tired man
and rumors spread of mutiny
and though the time will come when
dream and day unite
tonight the only consolation causing
him to fight
in fearless faith in destiny

Even when plans fall to pieces
I can still find the courage
with promise I've found in my faith

Likely or not, it's a dream that we keep
and at odds with our senses we'll climb
But if faith is the answer, we're already
reached it
And if spirit's a sign
then it's only a matter of time

"Dignity"

"At a year's end many will experience a feeling of melancholy, considering that which will never return. To others it is a moment of anticipation for the possibilities of conquering the new. Others yet will experience a concern facing a change that provides uncertainty and possible deterioration. All of these emotions are each in their own understandable. Someone said the other day that we reside in the great time of rupture."
[Quote by Olof Palme, Swedish prime-minister (S) 1969-1976, 1982-1986, assassinated 1986, murder still unsolved. Words culled from his New Year's speech to the nation 1969]

Prince of lies is on his knees
Holy rites, spreading the disease
By his side a youthful girl
Wedlocked force unfurls
She's young
Far too young

Far too young

Can we dictate a life with dignity?
Foul agenda corrupt in secrecy
Oh no no no no no

One false prayer wielding blasphemy
Price the spirit as a wanted property
Oh no no no no no

Congratulations to the five men of affairs
There was a purpose with this life
Insinuations (that) if she holds anything dear
Then it motivates submission in his lair

He is waiting for darkness
He opens the door
He's slithering

"Heart in Hand"

"It's simply woeful. Yuck!"
"Who the hell are you?"
[Quote from "Skrot-Nisse" by Jan Lööf]

Take it as a threat now and leave
Drop of toxins flows to a habit
Tell me what it is you can't see
Teeth grinding flesh in the sabbat
Factual drowning stream, you believe
Slaves will follow conspiracy
Turn the locks on brother and kin
Murder lust on affinity

War in utopia
Slay cornucopia for symmetry

The parody is real
And we're biding time
And while losing ground, make sure to worship monarchy
Death is but a story in a land of borrowed wealth
The burdened scale weighs heavy with the hunt for dopamine

Intolerance disguised as a faith
In secrecy we shun empathy
Soul critique online far too late
A throne for the devout enemy

War in utopia
Slay cornucopia for symmetry

The parody is real
And we're biding time
And while losing ground, make sure to worship monarchy
Death is but a story in a land of borrowed wealth
The burdened scale weighs heavy with the hunt for dopamine

When I was young
So, so much younger than today
It seemed easier to lead your life
There was no time to surrender
And no reason to perceive
The burden of pain
As it passed through our lives every year somehow
And it never (really) went away
Yet behind my door
Was a kingdom
A secret outline showed the way
To treasures of clay
And beads made of glass

"Yuck!"

"Next of Kin"

Every morrow, every year
Choir of sounds
The final sorrow, so shed a tear

Someone dies within creation
Doubts in everlasting life
How to lie to one innocent child
You are loved, I'm execrated
You belong, I circle strife
Routine pathways in escape from the wild

We are left in a city all alone
In the breathing of ashes
On the earth, one second
Just a piece of meat in essence

Every morrow, every year
Choir of sounds
The final sorrow, so shed a tear

We are left in a city all alone
In the breathing of ashes
On the earth, one second
Just a piece of meat in essence

We are left in a world that's burning
Crawling through embers to safety
And my name is next to last
Feast on famine and death on the broadcast

Finding friends in algorithms
Forgot the sound of my daughter's voice
Please remind me of my emptiness
The hissing of machines lost rhythm
As death would give an interview
In a metropolitan holiness

I am outside waiting
Outside waiting
I am outside waiting
Outside waiting

Am I the last one of my kind,
Who's afraid of dying?
But I would perish to save a child
And give all I can for love
It seems I might have reconciled
Even if my destiny's lying
For the ones I hold dear I hold close
And force my way through the ether

"Lovelorn Crime"

A voice through vapor
20 yards ahead
Is calling for your name
The empty paper
Waiting on the bed
It sets the waiting game

Credits to a dream

You can always strike me down
You can always say I'm wrong
You can always strike me down
But I will always wait for you

Ghost of memories, heavy on my brow
But changing over time
New ambitions corrupting every vow
Unfolding lovelorn crime

You can always strike me down
You can always say I'm wrong
You can always strike me down
But I will always wait for you
Yes, I will always wait for you

Three hundred weapons on manhunt
Craving more blood to its name

There comes a time in life when death may come too slow

Honesty in the necrology
The offspring smear your name in print

You have waited far too long
But Spring is set in bloom
You have conquered love inside
Yet sorrow is your doom

The debts are long since paid, inheritance is set
Still agitation reels inside, lest you forget
Lest you forget

At sunrise Friday morning
A haven for your sins
The written dedication
Etched into your skin

Time won't heal the wounds you bare
Between old pride and desperate prayers

Time won't heal any wounds you bare
A set few years of your life are stolen
Light cast on the obvious
Behold the white when it's faded golden

A stranger's truth holds no water here
But soon we may have learned
Dead sympathy, a aversion proceeds

A voice lives in your chest
That comforts wary thoughts
Yet the brook is still too wide
To bridge the gap you've sought

Honesty in the necrology
The offspring smear your name in print

You trade your vices every day religiously
A pack of vultures wait for everyone to see

You gave away too much, a harness on your kin
For any transgressions never mirrored mortal sin
Mortal sin

You're still alone

The day in zenith now
You made it through the night
Voice of perdition
Came and went far out of sight

"The Garroter"

Lone hunter in the fray
Of a lonely fading light
A manifest for the garroter
Stuck to his plight

Young and elder, nevermind
Programmed mortal set lifeline

A mother says no
And father cracks a simple plan
A knife is sharpened
His children run but he'll advance

Alas, how fragile life can be
Love is strong when death foresees
Yet the story won't end here
No, oh no, oh no

Ulterior motive
The grinning face of leadership
A selfish wish to control
A nation in his grip

Strong against weak and immobilized
Secular for fascist lies

The beautiful people
Look down from ruby vantage points
While in the gutter
Starvation invites us to join

Barricades of wealthy youth
Protesting their inborn truth

"Continuum"

Empty house, and empty pockets
There's an echo in the hall
I keep your picture in a locket
In the past, we had it all
But the Summer fades away
Rainy day tomorrow

In the company of dawning
In the presence of a friend
I was subject to a wanting
And unable to ascend
So I opened up my gate
It's too late to wonder

"It's just another day, nothing special has happened"
[Bruno K Öijer, Swedish poet]

Once there was a moment
Time was on my side
Rust and silk bestowment
Balanced on my pride

You are moving away from home
Escaping the monochrome
One after another
Striding along the road
Past the crest, you will be free
Laid to rest now, let it be
Honest promise to a degree
The edge too sharp for guarantees

Once there was a moment
Time was on my side
Rust and silk bestowment
Balanced on my pride

A part of our past is still there
Underneath your shoes
The memory's stuck in your chest
The idle truth is up to you
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless

Life is so fragile, I know
And even if I heard
A yearning voice in your heart
Old routines always kept us apart
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless

"All Things Will Pass"

Rose of Summer, withered times
Shadows fall on contouring lines
Far beyond a sleeping wish
Lunar tongue on a lasting bliss

Dead within a dream
Icy river stream

Lend yourself...

Clouds of dust in a waning light
You have given up on plight
Time is now, my dearest friend
Hidden years and a heart to mend

And should we meet again
The loss of everything
Three wishes to a friend
Three hundred sorrows gather
But if we lend ourselves
Amidst rock and poison grime
There may well be a time
A kingdom past its prime

Dead within a dream
Icy river stream

Your silver voice in my throat
Potion without an antidote
A routine death for the well-immersed
After all, the years have left us cursed
A simple test in an iron cage
Old tradition in a modern age
Strong and true are the weak at heart
I am you, you am I

If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?
If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?
If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?

"Persephone"

A beloved name inside my heart
A fleeting glance became the start
A missing word I am still awaiting
A wretched deception I am creating

<|endoftext|>

"Sorceress"

I am a sinner and I worship evil
Blood is thinner but you will never know
Can you confess that you thrive in chaos?
You're a sorceress and your eye is on the lost

But you're dying
It's in your eyes

You're a charlatan
You get everything you wish
You're a harlot
Carry poison in your kiss

Beg forgiveness
With a dagger in your hand
Sow your death seed
And reap the dying lands

But you're crying
It's only vice

Empty vessel
Drained of hope
And none the lesser at the end of
A rope
Have you ever hated like I?
Know I still awaited the absence of lies

Watch your eager tongue
Attack me from behind

Riddle whispers
Bleak futile control
Like a twin sister
Adapting to a role

You're a murderer
Bloodlust increase
You're a harvester
Come close to spread disease

And you're hiding
I hear you cry

<|endoftext|>

"The Wilde Flowers"

Sun hangs high, I turn away
Failure underground
Heart is sick and fever is high
Waiting for a sound

Like a trail of insects to me
I watch them from afar
Feeding, breeding, scheming
Tell me I am wrong

Hiding from discovery
Staring down into the ground
Had they seen the posion in me
A tide of spite wound be found

Moving faster lingering gaze
Feasting on my sanity
A grain of sand against endless waves
A wish for the slaughter of conformity

Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre

Inside me sleeps a violence waiting to be freed

[Solo: Åkesson]

Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre

Blinding light and the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Should I speak and they'll call me a liar
I'll retreat to my funeral pyre

My sanctuary, a thousand centuries
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting

<|endoftext|>

"Will O The Wisp"

When you're tired of waiting and time is not on your side
When you're tired of hating me, you no longer want to hide

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

When there's trouble admitting that you have been wrong all along
When the words you have written down reads "everything is gone"

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

When you smother your friendships and take much more than you need
When you can't keep a secret to yourself and points to the source of the deed

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And you can never find the satisfaction
When you can't outgrow your false distractions

[Solo: Fred Åkesson]

You know your soul is weighed on the silver scale of deceit and lies

"Chrysalis"

And on the furthest day
When you lay down
Discard your disarray
And your rusted crown
And face the wretched image of you and I
No trust in what you say
You are a dead poison seed
Stronger when you're away
You have nothing that I need
The rhyme has settled in the ghost of a sigh
Nothing now remains
Now you will leave me be

Sunrise into the moonlight
A broken body lies in wait
Your prize won you the stark night
And you made peace with your fate
Blind eyes sensitive only to white light
Reacting just a bit too late

Preying on insecurity
A design of your schemes
A true believer of purity
Must tend to what it means
Or allow its gospel to turn into a lie
You forsake everything you feel
In favor of despair
Immune and blind to everything that is real
In your secret lair
And cast away the captive heart that was thine

And you will go and leave me be

Winter in your soul, building a wasteland
And you tread a thin ice 'neath your feet
Sneering and everyone you would shun
Collecting flowers to your wreath
Lifeline, a river cuts deep in your cold hand
It's changing when you try to breathe

[Solo: Åkesson, Svalberg, Åkesson, Svalberg]

Leave it all behind you
There is comfort in giving up
A seed in barren soil
Might curl up into a coil
Flourish into something new
Give back what you thought was "you"
And give way to all that is new

[Solo: Åkerfeldt]

Leave it all behind you

"Sorceress 2"

Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line

And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away

Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line

And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away

Ice melting into the sea
Your river flowing back to me

And when you take your final breath
In many years from now, no less
I hope you feel a peace at heart
Do not be afraid to kiss the dark

And do not ever wonder if I stayed
My love for you cannot die away

<|endoftext|>

"The Seventh Sojourn"

Hold me in your arms
Never do me harm
Never do me harm
Hold me in your arms

A raging sea in your eyes
Gives away your disguise
Grants me the peace to leave
And finally leave you be

<|endoftext|>

"Strange Brew"

An afternoon walk through the park
I keep to the shadows until it's dark
I am not educated nor free of sin
I carry thoughts of giving in

There is a void surrounding me
No sound, and in the black I can not see
There is a chasm between you and me
You have no face, no body, no words to speak

[Solo: Åkerfeldt, Åkesson]

There is a wickedness in me
I cannot seem to make it go away
I am a spiritual leper, but I can see
A flock of believers gone astray
There is eternal night in my gaze
I am cast out and I am not like you
Find my way on through the haze
I am liquefied in a strange brew

An early morn walk through the park
I look to the sun when it's cold and stark

I blend with the crowd of robot minds
Never a leader, I am always behind

[4x]
A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears

<|endoftext|>

"A Fleeting Glance"

Up until recently I have been alone
Leading a tranquil life, but never at home
Something had changed and I turned to the wind
That blew through me and told me,
"How long? How long?"

Silenced the voice of my heart now for years
I was perplexed by a fleeting blank stare
Biding my time until courage had built up inside me
Then came clean
"Or am I wrong"

[Solo: Åkerfeldt]

I spend all my days contemplating my will
For the weak shall inherit the earth
When it's still
A government bid for my life
I was sold as a cog in a machine
"I walk the line"

A fleeting glance again
Tells me everything
Took a chance in vain
Drawn to a futile idea
A pursuit of happiness
As the storm rolls in
An idol of helplessness
Paved the way and then gave in

I met with my mother and I asked her why
For ten years or more she would never reply
Suddenly she said we're all born to die
Gave me purpose
Freed me
"How simple it can be"

But it's fading away from my mind
There's another "me" waiting behind

[Solo: Åkerfeldt]

But it's fading away from my mind
There's another "me" waiting behind

<|endoftext|>

"Era"

There is a sign in the rain
Every now and again
It's a symbol of hope
In the midst of a catastrophic episode
In the hour of death
There is a spiritual wealth
When we dance through the rain
And form the signs once again

If even for a second

I hear a voice on the air
It has a warning to share
"Do not believe what you see.
You cannot perceive what you feel."
But if I do what I am told
And shun the spirit I hold
I am no longer a human
And I will not shift with the sands

[2x]
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

There are moments of doubt
When I do not know what to do
And giving in is the only way out
When there is too much shouting
About how I should choose
Incapacitated, I am left behind
In a sea of hatred I go blind
A storm is coming, I hide away
In the years of need reason leads astray

[Solo: Åkesson]

[2x]
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

"Persephone (Slight Return)"

The years went by with disquieting grace
A past obsession sunk without a trace
I moved into winter and found my home
As my boiling blood had turned to chrome

<|endoftext|>

"The Ward"

I am going away
I am going down

Sifting through a memory
Before it fades away
Adolescent secrecy
A million words astray

I cannot remember happiness
I thrive within the dark
The security of a loneliness
Is a veil that keeps my calm

By the way, I am doing fine
I have a place to stay, just behind the sunshine
And by the way, I do not need sympathy
I have a place to lay
I have more than you can see

I walk the streets alone at night
It helps to ease my mind
I lay me down come the morning light
And leave all woes behind

<|endoftext|>

"Spring MCMLXXIV"

On a wind that is sailing through the morning
I have cut the harness off of my heart
On a tide that's rising with the dawning
I find I belong inside the dark

And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page

Carry me home

There is a dream that tells me I am haunted
It comes to visit every fortnight or so
I wake up having lost all I have ever wanted
And a bleak apparition wants what I hold

And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page

Carry me home

Should it disappear, should it go away
Would it mend the wounds I bare, the wounds of love
Could it reappear like a familiar tale?
Like a broken friendship that snuffs the moonlight above

<|endoftext|>

"Eternal Rains Will Come"

Eternal rains will come
We should say goodbye
And suffer on our own
As all our thoughts were wrong

So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
And when the flood comes to drown us
There is nothing we can do

You told me not to wait
Unless I could wait forever
Because there is no time for us
Take comfort in what was

So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
And when the flood comes to drown us
There is nothing we can do

Here it comes, our death comes
And in my sleep I can't forget

Reaching for the surface, I see you

<|endoftext|>

"Cusp Of Eternity"

A child of autumn was born
Into a world of deceit and death
And a land of ice
A break of bonds would take her away
And install a sense of loss and eternal sorrow

She walks across the country
She holds her head up high in the rain
A mother is screaming for help
And she turns around to stare
At a scene from her memory

She is hiding a wish in her heart
That flows through her blood always
And it's culled from a dream
That someone is waiting to say her name
And call her to his side at the cusp of eternity

<|endoftext|>

"Moon Above, Sun Below"

You are sleeping unhampered by guilt
Comes the morning you shut down
The devil's breath is a disease on your lips
Reaching out for your loss
You prey on your flock

Seeking out the weaker hearts
With eternity in your grip
And on a lifelong throne of sub-religion
They will eat from your hand

With the moon above and the sun below

I can't remember the sun upon my skin
Slave to a sorrow that is whispering within
I'm always waiting for you before I sleep
There is no comfort in the distance that we keep

In a river of grief I am drowning
And your grip is surrounding my heart
Balancing on the edge of failure
And relieved, should I fall
Scattered dust upon my eyes
A winding road taking you nowhere
A winding road taking me home
And my home is my grave

Waiting for a day when there is nothing left to say

Voices of despair is a familiar friendship
A society in your head holds the code to destruction

Dying fast
Summer dying fast
And this can't last, as nothing ever lasts
In a forest of flesh
There is a need to sever myself away from happiness

Still no drifting sun
Black upon the earth
Still the air is dry
And the locust wait

There is no help in the wake of our needs
There is no help to dispel the pain
There is no help yet some cling to a phantom
There is no help, only circles on the water

Only circles on the water

<|endoftext|>

"Elysian Woes"

What is left when the morning comes
Is the memory of a future
And when my plight is done
There is nothing left to hold on to

There were friends waiting at my door
They are gone now, for the year is new
I stuck by my word
And when the rains came
Made it true and pure, to dissolve the hurt

Are we nursing destruction?
Pursuing a dream we once had
Was it our intention
to follow this road 'til the end
Even if the end is a world of sorrow?

There is a bond between us
Even if it's frayed it is unbreakable
So I come for you always
And I welcome pain
For a second of belonging somewhere
There were times when I lost my way
With hope pouring from my soul
In a shelter from the sun
I don't want to bare my scars for you

<|endoftext|>

"River"

Show me a sign of troubles in your heart
Spare me your lies and tell me that you're mine

And our bodies float on the river
To the oceans of demise

Made me a slave to the secrets of your silence
But you told me to stay
And you told me you're mine

And our bodies float on the river
To the oceans of demise

In light of all things to come, why do you despair?
Because when you have no one, no one would care
So don't care

And all things will come undone
There is nothing to share
I'll be waiting for no one
And no one is there to care

Can't see, can't feel
You run, I long
I wait, he comes
Takes you away

'Cause he can feel you (on the)
On the way to comfort you

In the embers of summer
All things must die
There's a passage of fire ahead
Fire on the other side

There comes a time when the river runs dry
Winter comes and we sacrifice
Our lives

<|endoftext|>

"Voice Of Treason"

The mist is sleeping on the water
And winter is hiding in my heart
Thorns in my eyes are slowing me down
I can't pass through to the other side
She knows I'm the one who sought her
But when we fall, we'll fall so hard
She holds a secret and won't show me how
How to break the riddle in her eyes

This is treason of the mind and soul
There's no reason why you would go

Inside the ghost of love is laughing
It mocks the footsteps where I go
It tells me nothing has been lost
It whispers, "You've seen darkness before."
In time the hurting will subside
And longing is overthrown
What's left is a void that grows inside
And the echo of a failure

This is treason of the mind and soul
There's no reason why you would go

Have you ever had the feeling of a sorrow inside?
Have you ever been the reason why a hope subsides?
Have you ever seen the aftermath of giving up?

Have we given up?
Is it over?
Have you given up?
Is winter hiding in your heart?

<|endoftext|>

"Faith In Others"

The grave of our youth is up ahead
And life has become a burden
We move in circles of suppressed despair
Waiting for the sun
And turning stones to find evidence
But it hides in the recesses of our hearts

Written the creed of our loss
And we carried no faith in the cross
And the cold years are coming
For the victims of a longing

Out through the doors of starvation
And into the rains of damnation
Where the bitter winds are singing
For the victims of a longing

We carried along through squalor
With an inborn need to dominate and possess
It gives birth to an anger inside
And we can't control this
The blood of departure in our tracks
Dripping from our emptying vessels
Your hand reached out to hold mine
But you're grasping melting ice

Asleep in the rain
A child once again
And the ghost in my head
Has forgiven me

Lifted his curse upon me

<|endoftext|>

"The Devil's Orchard"

This trail is obsidian,
The grip of winter uncoiled
A lover would follow me
Cast down and sworn to the dark

Take the road where devils speak
"God is dead"
"God is dead"

The wealth of darkness
Inside you telling you "now"
Your senses corrupted
Controlling a poisonous will

Take the road where devils speak
"God is dead"
"God is dead"

In the corner of my eye
Tearing flesh from bone

Led the blind in search to find
A pathway to the sun
Saw the signs intertwine
And forgave me all my sins

No stigmas revealing our vices
And there are no stigmas revealing our vices

God is dead

<|endoftext|>

"I Feel The Dark"

I feel the dark when I see you
I feel the dark when I see you

Loosen the harness of trust
Survey an impulse of lust
The thespian is far away
Uprooted yet forced to stay

Sing a lie, ghost of the night
Give yourself to me
The road is long and winding still
And these bonds will start to fray
But another day

A flaking wish inside

Veiled comes the daylight through the glass
In the never-ending rain
This is no friend of mine
Stalking the comfort within

A flaking wish inside
The mother of lies

And you're going out to war
When the beast is coming home
And the sun is seen no more
For the devil's love you bore

I feel the dark when I see you

<|endoftext|>

"Slither"

Summer's gone and love has withered
I believe in nothing yet nothing is what it seems
All is gone and promises slithered
You gave me nothing yet nothing is what it seems

Summer is gone

Your eyes gave away all your lies in the end
The dawning of a seething design
Kept a secret from the light
And felt the weight on my shoulders increase

A bleeding heart led my desperation
Like a bird on a wire
A broken promise of dedication
Never ever again

<|endoftext|>

"Nepenthe"

Hope would fail me in the falling snow
And slake a wish inside

Friends would leave me in my darkest hour
Yet trust me with their lives

She would haunt my dreams and feed my demons
They tell me to go

<|endoftext|>

"Häxprocess"

A lifeline in a drop of blood
A dying wish to shun a God
Sought a dream inside the light
Finally relieved from plight

O this night is deceiving
One eternal winter
Earth below and reeling
Moon is riding high

Father and a liar
One forgotten season
Secrets in the mire
Moon is riding high

Aligning

A name inside a memory
Waiting for you
When words can't win her
There is nothing to do

Save your children
Drenched in poverty
Tracks in the snow
Leading them to woe

<|endoftext|>

"Famine"

I can't see your face
And I can't breathe your air
So I wonder why I get cold inside
When I hear your name

When we meet eye to eye
I will ask how and why
And when guilt has its way
One lesser reason to stay
And I will see her cry

Into the fire of our youth comes the devil again
And you feel your way, feel your way

Saw you standing nigh
In the corner
Told me that you had died
And I would die when my heart was empty
Become a ghost in perpetual void
And neglect all reasons why

<|endoftext|>

"The Lines In My Hand"

We are dying in the wake of gods and decrees remain arcane
And everything around us is a consequence of pain

The writings on the wall depict a truth that no one reads
A government of puppets blinded by another creed

Burning voice of insanity
Nothing is the same
Barren lands for the idle man
Find all the lines in your hand

Blinding storms are surrounding us
Take control
In our cups, poisoned wine
Find all the lines in your hands

<|endoftext|>

"Folklore"

Hey you, will you be true
When you can see through what I do
Feel the pain in your brain, insane
Will I see my name in your scars

And you will see what you mean to me

Lust between the lines
Do you feel the need
When the night comes down
And when the night comes down
A father is waiting

And you will see what you mean to me

Lost control and called your name
Left a home in the pouring rain
In a sea of guilt and shame
Will we sustain

<|endoftext|>

"Pyre"

[Bonus Track]

Follow the embers into cities of dreams
What you've been seeing is not all what it seems
Dawn of the liars
Future's a pyre

Outside the window I see people passing by
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry
Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep
I wish this beating would so reveal the love I keep

Look down your senses
Await the gritting beyond
And in the morning this starkness would trail alone

Born as a failure and dying as a stranger
When your country's bleeding while you're forced to mourn

Outside the window I see people passing by
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry
Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep
I wish this beating would so reveal the love I keep

"Bring me back again"

"Face In The Snow"

[Bonus Track]

No more wishes for the past
No lingering of sages and seers
And desperations and fevers last,
The undertows are stronger here.

And here I lie, another morning arrives
Too far away from coming home

I see a face in the snow, inside my head a voice calls for me
I see your face in the snow and outside the sun's too far away to feel

And here I lie, another morning arrives,
Too far away from coming home.

And here I lie, another morning arrives,
Too far away from coming home

And could we live within the wake of aging lies
When we re too far away?

<|endoftext|>

"The Throat Of Winter"

The throat of Winter is upon us
And the cold will linger in me

Sheild of the eternal river again

Our fevered bodies will return
to the bowels of the vast decrepit earth

The devil spoke and called us to his side

Never will return again
Never will I feel the rain
Never will return again
Never will I feel the rain

Throat of Winter

A demigod is observing us through child-like eyes
And his hordes are returning now
A demigod is observing us with child-like eyes
And his hordes are returning now

<|endoftext|>

"Would?"

[Alice In Chains cover]

Know me broken by my master,
Teach thee on child of love hereafter,

Into the flood again,
Same old trip it was back then,
So I made a big mistake,
Try to see it once my way.

Drifting body, it's sole desertion,
Flying, not yet quite the notion.

Into the flood again,
Same old trip it was back then,
So I made a big mistake,
Try to see it once my way.

Into the flood again,
Same old trip it was back then,
So I made a big mistake,
Try to see it once my way.

Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home
Have I gone?
And left you here alone

Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home, yeah
Have I gone?
And left you here alone

If I would, could you?

"Mellotron Heart"

I lost all I had (that April day)
I turned to my friends (nothing to say)
I wrote down a name (and read it twice)
I wallowed in shame

I said that I loved (eternal schemes)
I cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I promise to stay (and held my breath)
I went far away

Icy roads beneath my feet
Lead me through wastelands of deceit
Rest your head now, don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghosts of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now, don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

<|endoftext|>

"Coil"

She told me
Why she told me lies
Always take care of this
I told her how I've always stayed
Always waiting for nothing

[x2]
When I get out of here
When I leave you behind
I'll find that the years passed us by

And I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
Yes I can, see you
Running through the fields of sorrow

[x2]
When you get out of here
When you leave me behind
You'll find that the years passed us by

And I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
Yes I can, see you
Running through the fields of sorrow

"Heir Apparent"

Cold days
Old ways
Told lies
No more

So many years to clean the slate
Endless despair within its wake
His touch soiling what used to be clean
His gaze burning on the edge of our dreams

No more
Cold days
Cold days

And again he rides in
It's September and he covets the gullible
Skeletal wish
Hunter
A thousand lies cast from the throne of secrecy

Hear him spewing forth a meaning to miserable lives
See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair
The insect trust
Believer
Your body a vehicle to him just the same

Pearls before swine they are nothing but blind
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn
Invisible king
Dying
Procession of woe struck down by sorrow

A burden so great weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs
The swift solution crumbles beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece
Death in his eyes
Waiting
Spiralling judgement provoked in the rains

Futile test drowned in the levee of deception
His futile test drowned in the levee of deception

In the year of his sovereign
Rid us of your judgement
Heir apparent

<|endoftext|>

"The Lotus Eater"

The liquid is in your throat
For hopeless delight

After all you fell in love with death,
Life has aborted.
All you've had and all you became,
The night is calling, you pray forth.

The barren waste is your land
Your crops, they were sown to die

The skin is a mirror
The eyes hollow with ignorance
Health runs from your lips
Sucked in and safe in a world of sleep

All those years caring for a liar
A benefit road that is winding higher
You're a moth too close to the fire

You are stuck in a route of confusion
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all

Fleeing your sorrows
Pushing your spirit away

Sick of the weakness of the psyche
A whisper from the heart of evil luring them all into despair
Resenting the goods of a savior

And cries out
For the restless will also die

A selection culled from the damned, drawing a lifeline of one
A friend died in your room and sought the birth of a follower

O brother, you are a killer and you target yourself
I wish you'd never come back for us to see the beckoning end

And the pride of a mother brought flaws in a mother's son
And the love from a father was used by a father's son

Overheard us talking in a smoke of lost hope
The language of a parting so clear and so true
Overheard us talking

<|endoftext|>

"Burden"

I,
Once upon a time,
Carried a burden inside.
I sung a last goodbye,
A broken rhyme
I'd underlined.
There's an ocean of sorrow in you

Sorrow in me

Saw movement in their eyes
Said I no longer knew the way
Given up the ghost
A passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand

Waiting to fail

Failing again

If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear
You've taken more than we've received
And the ocean of sorrow is you

"Porcelain Heart"

[Mikael Akerfeldt]

I lost all I had (that April day),
I turned to my friends (nothing to say),
I wrote down a name (and read it twice),
I wallowed in shame.

I said that I loved (eternal schemes),
I cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I promised to stay (and held my breath)
I went far away.

Icy roads beneath my feet,
Lead me through wastelands of deceit,
Rest your head now, don't you cry,
Don't ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghost of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now, don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reasons why.

"Hessian Peel"

Will the children cry
When their mother dies
And in the autumn of their lives
Will they feel the same?

[reversed lyrics 2:03-2:22:]
"I see you
My sweet Satan
Come back tonight
Out of the courtyard"

Her longing for me
Comin' down like hail
Why did you leave me?

Come here inside
Come tell me how
How in my final days
I found the rout

The light comes on
The signal for us to end our lives
You wait beneath the white sheets and you wait forever

The night comes on
Your weakness starting to erase all your lies
So I left you alone
We all left you alone

[reversed lyrics 7:21-7:24:]
"They'll lock all your reasons why"

Lock the children away from harm
They'll lock all your reason why
Seeking tenderness with a dagger
Skin is blocked by the years of trial

You felt abandoned in the fog of flesh
Sitting in place from the dead
Awaiting the face of the moon to ascend
You follow the siren in your head

In your head

<|endoftext|>

"Hex Omega"

Two years
In your heart
One moment of doubt

Two lives
Torn apart
One second from now

Held him
In your arms
Your fever subside
Always safe from harm
Kept demons inside

Still you always start runnin'
Touch the light
From the moon
Some way mother cried
Left us space here

<|endoftext|>

"Derelict Herds"

[Bonus track]

Someone died for looking too far
While I was asleep in my house
A child was killed, I heard it from a friend
A war raged in a distant land
Cost me to linger on a piece of text

Someone died
Not here, never here

There was a fever
There is a failure
Are you a believer?
That someone lied to you

You hold it closer to your chest
There was a meaning for this test
But you forgot and it's gone now
You were controlled somehow

There was a mean time
An invitation of sorts
I remember life
I, I was sick with sorrow

I'd fallen asleep
And dreamt of my sins here
It was your turn
Adamant smile and said, "Thank you"

There was a sickness right in the family
While I shuddered in the cold
Woman hanged for her sins while I craved mine
An old man drowned in this life herd
As I made amends with my fathers

Someone died
Not here, never here

<|endoftext|>

"Bridge Of Sighs"

[Robin Trower cover]

[x2]
Sun don't shine
The moon don't move
The tides to wash me clean

Why so unforgiving
And why so cold
Spent a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs

[x2]
Cold wind blows
And the gods look down
In anger of this poor child

Why so unforgiving
And why so cold
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs

"Den Ständiga Resan"

[Bonus track]

När jag tänker på den ständiga resan genom livet
När det alltid känns som höst
Då vänder sig vinden sakta mot norr
Och blommorna dör
Det faller regn i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen efter ömhetens röst
Jag måste resa igen till nästa höst
Den ständiga resan till nästa höst

[Guitar]

När jag vandrar på den steniga vägen genom livet
När det känns som jag bar på en sorg
Då gömmer sig solen sakta i moln
Och ordet är adjö
Snart faller snö i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen efter ömhetens röst
Jag måste resa igen till nästa höst
Den ständiga resan till nästa höst
Oh den ständiga resan till nästa höst

[Guitar]

[English translation:]

The Perpetual Journey

When I think of the perpetual journey through life
When it always feels like autumn
The wind moves slowly to the north
And the flowers die
Rain falls in my dreams

I must travel again and search for comfort
I must search again for the voice of tenderness
I must travel again to next autumn
The perpetual journey to next autumn

When I wander on the stony road through life
When it felt like I carried a sorrow
Then the sun hides slowly in the clouds
and [indistinct] goodbye
Soon the snow falls in my dreams

I must travel again and search for comfort
I must search again for the voice of tenderness
I must travel again to next autumn
The perpetual journey to next autumn
Oh the perpetual journey to next autumn

"Ghost Of Perdition"

Ghost of Mother
Lingering death
Ghost on Mother's bed
Black strands on the pillow
Contour of her health
Twisted face upon the head

Ghost of perdition
Stuck in her chest
A warning no one read
Tragic friendship
Called inside the fog
Pouring venom brew deceiving

Devil cracked the earthly shell
Foretold she was the one
Blew hope into the room and said:
"You have to live before you die young"

Holding her down
Channeling darkness
Hemlock for the Gods
Fading resistance
Draining the weakness
Penetrating inner light

Road into the dark unaware
Winding ever higher

Darkness by her side
Spoke and passed her by
Dedicated hunter
Waits to pull us under
Rose up to it's call
In his arms she'd fall
Mother light received
And a faithful servant's free

In time the hissing of her sanity
Faded out her voice and soiled her name
And like marked pages in a diary
Everything seemed clean that is unstained
The incoherent talk of ordinary days
Why would we really need to live?
Decide what is clear and what's within a haze
What you should take and what to give

Ghost of perdition
A saint's premonition's unclear
Keeper of holy hordes
Keeper of holy whores

To see a beloved son
In despair of what's to come

If one cut the source of the flow
And everything would change
Would conviction fall
In the shadow of the righteous
The phantasm of your mind
Might be calling you to go
Defying the forgotten morals
Where the victim is the prey

<|endoftext|>

"The Baying Of The Hounds"

I hear the baying of the hounds
In the distance, I hear them devouring
Pest ridden jackals of the earth
Diabolical beasts and roaming the forests
In wait and constant protectors
Calling you to sit by his side
Your self loathing image in his flesh
A revelation upon which you linger

His words are flies
Swarming towards the true insects
Feasting on buried dreams
And spreading decay upon your skin
His eyes spew forth a darkness
That cut through and paralyze
Casts light upon your secrets
Forced to confront your enemies

His mouth is a vortex
Sucking you into it's pandemonium
Fools you with a helping hand of ashes
Reached out in false dismay
His body is a country
The cities lay dead and beyond despair
Friends turned enemies unable to come clean
In a rising fog of reeking death

Everything you believed is a lie
Everyone you loved is a death burden
So you take comfort in him
And you are receptive to stark wishes
No longer struggling to declare your stand
You would inflict no harm to others
They are unaware of you
And in a loop of futile events
You are everything, they are nothing

Drown in the deep mire
With past desires
Beneath the mire
Drown desire now with you

Lined up verses on dead skin
"The tainted lips of the stranger
Resting upon hers"

And I embrace bereavement
Everything beloved is shattered anyway
I would devote myself to anyone
I would accept any flaws

I am too weak to resist
Tension vibrating with horror
Finding the outcast in my eyes
Pushing nerves on a puppet
Endless poison in my veins
Clean intent now tainted with death

And so, cold touch now inhumane
Every waking hour
Awaiting a reverie to unfold
And now they are calling me
Louder by the minute
The baying of the hounds
Calling me back to my home

<|endoftext|>

"Beneath The Mire"

Haunted nights for halcyon days
Can't sleep to the scraping of his voice
Nature's way struck grief in me
And I became a ghost in sickness

Willingly guided into heresy
Beneath the surface, stark emptiness
And you'd pity my conviction
Whereas I thought of myself as a leader

You'd cling to your pleasant hope
It is twisted fascination
While I'd ruin the obstacles into despair
And I'm praising death

Lost love of the heart
In a holocaust scene memory

Decrepit body wearing transparent skin
Inside, the smoke of failure

Wept for solace and submit to faith
In his shadow I'm choking
Yet flourishing

Master

A delusion made me stronger
Yet I'm draped in pale withering flesh
I sacrificed more than I had
And left my woes beneath the mire

<|endoftext|>

"Atonement"

Cleared the fog that was veiled around me
And blurred my sights
Suddenly, I'm no longer aching
To honor my plights

Rising moon and my skin is peeling
Past undone
Suddenly, I can't justify
What I had become

<|endoftext|>

"Reverie / Harlequin Forest"

Into the trees
Past meadow grounds
And further away from my home
Baying behind me
I hear the hounds
Flock's chasing to find me alone

A trail of sickness
Leading to me
If I am haunted
Then you will see

Searching the darkness
And emptiness
I'm hiding away from the sun
Will never rest
Will never be at ease
All my matter's expired so I run

There falls another
Vapor hands released the blade
Insane regrets at the drop
Instruments of death before me

Lose all to save a little
At your peril it's justified
And dismiss your demons
As death becomes a jest
You are the laughing stock
Of the absinthe minded
Confessions stuck in your mouth
And long gone fevers reappear

Nocturnally helpless
And weak in the light
Depending on a prayer
Pacing deserted roads to find
A seed of hope

They are the trees
Rotten pulp inside and never well
Roots sucking, thieving from my source
Tired boughs reaching for the light

It is all false pretension
Harlequin forest
Awaiting redemption for a lifetime
As they die alone
With no one by their side
Are they forgiven?

Stark determination
Poisoning the soul
Unfettered beast inside
Claiming sovereign control

And now the woods are burning
Tearing life crops asunder
Useless blackened remains
Still pyre smoldering

<|endoftext|>

"Hours Of Wealth"

Found a way to rid myself clean of pain
And the fever that's been haunting me
Has gone away

Looking through my window
I seem to recognize
All the people passing by
But I am alone
And far from home
And nobody knows me

Never heard me say goodbye
Never shall I speak to anyone again
All days are in darkness
And I'm biding my time
Once I am sure of my task I will rise again

<|endoftext|>

"The Grand Conjuration"

Majesty
Faithful me
Pour yourself
Into me

Wield your power
Martyr's price
Stare me down
To the ground

The eyes of the devil
Fixed on his sinners

Slake my thirst
Eternal wealth
Heathen key
Round my neck

This poetry
Our blasphemy
Know the sounds
Of infamy

The hands of Satan
Assembling his flock
Pale horse rider
Scorching the earth

Whispered conjuration
A belief takes form
Choking hand tapping
The veins in your throat

His orders in your mouth
A decree for domination
Beneath the tides of wisdom
Spins the undertow of hate

Injected seeds of vengeance
Usurper's eyes of the powerless
Clean path to his kingdom
Beckoning in the mist

(The grand conjuration)

Tell me why
Love subsides
In the light
Of your wishes

Say my name
Ease the pain
Clear the smoke
In my head

<|endoftext|>

"Isolation Years"

There's a sense of longing in me
As I read Rosemary's letter
Her writing's honest
Can't forget the years she's lost

In isolation
She talks about her love
And as I read
"I'll die alone"
I know she was aching

There's a certain detail seen here
The pen must have slipped to the side
And left a stain
Next to his name
She knows he's gone

And isolation
Is all that would remain
"The wound in me is pouring out
To rest on a lover's shore"

<|endoftext|>

"Soldier Of Fortune"

[Deep Purple cover]

I have often told you stories
About the way
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand
And sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me love me
And I would surely stay
But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune
Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old
When nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here
Now I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune
Yes, I can hear the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

"Windowpane"

Blank face in the windowpane
Made clear in seconds of light
Disappears and returns again
Counting hours, searching the night

Might be waiting for someone
Might be there for us to see
Might be in need of talking
Might be staring directly at me

Inside plays a lullaby
Slurred voice over children cries
On the inside

Haunting loneliness in the eye
Skin covering a secret scar
His hand is waving a goodbye
There's no response or action returned

There is deep prejudice in me
Outshines all reason inside
Given dreams all ridden with pain
And projected unto the last

<|endoftext|>

"In My Time Of Need"

I can't see the meaning of this life I'm leading
I try to forget you as you forgot me
This time there is nothing left for you to take, this is goodbye

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away

Close to ending it all, I am drifting through the stages
Of the rapture born within this loss
Thoughts of death inside, tear me apart from the core of my soul

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away

At times the dark's fading slowly
But it never sustains
Would someone watch over me
In my time of need

<|endoftext|>

"Death Whispered A Lullaby"

Out on the road there are fireflies circling
Deep in the woods, where the lost souls hide
Over the hill there are men returning
Trying to find some peace of mind

Sleep my child

Under the fog there are shadows moving
Don't be afraid, hold my hand
Into the dark there are eyelids closing
Buried alive in the shifting sands

Sleep my child

Speak to me now and the world will crumble
Open a door and the moon will fall
All of your life, all your memories
Go to your dreams, forget it all

Sleep my child

<|endoftext|>

"Closure"

Heal myself-a feather on my heart
Look inside-there never was a start
Peel myself-dispose of severed skin
All subsides-around me and within

There's nothing painful in this
There's no upheaval
Redemption for my pathos
All sins undone

Awaiting word on what's to come
In helpless prayers a hope lives on
As I've come clean I've forgotten what I promised
In the rays of the sun I am longing for the darkness

<|endoftext|>

"Hope Leaves"

In the corner beside my window
There hangs a lonely photograph
There is no reason
I'd never notice
A memory that could hold me back

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place

Gone through days without talking
There is a comfort in silence
So used to losing all ambition
Struggling to maintain what's left

Once undone, there is only smoke
Burning in my eyes to blind
To cover up what really happened
Force the darkness unto me

<|endoftext|>

"To Rid The Disease"

There's nobody here, there's nobody near
I try not to care, dead eyes always stare
Let these matters be, don't trust what you see
Take hold of your time, step into the line

There's innocence torn from its maker
Stillborn the trust in you
This failure has made the creator
So would you tell him what to do (would you)

Leave your mark upon the head of someone
Who'll cry for his state, we know it's too late
I turn round to see what was meant to be
Faint movement release to rid the disease

There's innocence torn from its maker
Stillborn the trust in you
(I have lost all trust I had in you)
This failure has made the creator
So would you tell him what to do
(I have lost all trust I had in you)

"Weakness"

Found you there in the blink of an eye
(I) miss you
Turned away into a thousand dreams
Found out what they mean

Lost you there in a moment of truth
(I) trust you
Gave away the one and only heart
(A) gift to tear apart

Stain me, save me
Take me to my home
Hold me, show me
Take me to my home

Weaker now, drawing fluid from me
(You) kill me
I'm not afraid of what you have just done
(But of) what you've just become

"Wreath"

Falling inside again
This nightmare always the same
Still never enough
Halting at the brink of discovery

Moving into the darkness
Leaking inside to cover up
Dragging me down and under
Entangled and undone at once

Old memories
I'm not in need but wish to know
What are the tragedies
The history behind the walls

Pacing further down
Familiar children's laughter
Dissonant and out of time
And their eyes are dead

Watching myself in a pool of water
Wearing the mask of a ghost
Smeared all across my skin
Rotten earth and insects

Endless night
Always preserving the calm
Movement behind

Bleeding animals in a field of fire
There is no absolution
Death is but a fairytale
They are mere visions
They are afraid of me

Clear insight
A smoke is rising nearby
Dust covering my coat
Blend together to spell my name

Pale, covered me with sweat
There are no words left
Sole provider of death
Distorted faith in myself

Human harvest burning
Blackest pages turning
Twisted perception come true
Captured in dreams connected

Staring right back
Spiritual decay - Still seeking
Frozen in time
Mourn this departure - All watching

Calling me back
Closure to bleak matters - I'm leaving
End of a search
Coming of morning

Calling me back
Closure to bleak matters - I'm leaving
End of a search
Coming of morning - Returning

"Deliverance"

Floating on mist
Crept up the caverns of my brain
Received no warning
From nothing to a life code
Walk with me, you'll never leave
Wait to see your spirit free
Tell me how your heart's in need
As I drown you in the sea
Unwinding snares of distrust
Your wrist in my fast grip
Look me in the eye, I'm clear
This is your time
Face down beneath the waterline
Gazing into the deep
From love to death
In a time span of seconds
Oblivious to regret
Pushed into belief
In liquid cellophane
Gasping for air
Mercy in my eyes
Is the shade of the night
The piercing sounds you make
Soaring higher, higher now
And once left in my wake
Your memory is nothing but the scars on me
All over now
Forgotten why I needed this
Standing down
Disappear into the obscure
Resting days
Waiting for new disease
Biding time
Locked inside insanity
It always burns within
The downward spiral never ends
When driven into sin
Your salvation's found in a sinner's deed
The devil guides the way
Tells me what to say
Pours himself inside
And snuffs the final light

Deliverance
Thrown back at me

Deliverance
Laughing at me

"A Fair Judgement"

Losing sleep, in too deep
Fading sun, what have I done
Came so close to what I need most
Nothing left here
Cut the ties, uncover disguise
Left behind all intertwined
Lost control, moved out of the role now
Nothing's left here
Leave it be
It was meant for me
Soul sacrifice
Forgot the advice
Lost track of time
In a flurry of smoke
Waiting anxiety
For a fair judgement deserved

"Master's Apprentices"

There is a voice calling for me
There is a light coming down on me
There is a doubt that is clearing
There is a day that is dawning
There is a wound that is healing
There is a season waiting for me
There is a road that is turning
There is a fire still burning
A sickness in me
Constant pace towards the end
The need is stronger
This time the need is deeper

There is a peace I am searching
There is a freedom I'm depending on
There is a pain that's never ending
There is a rain falling only on me
There is a dream I am living
There is a life I am dreaming of
There is a death I'm awaiting
There is a home I am deserting

I hold my breath and wait
Only moments remain
Movement for departed hope
Effect for absent friend

Sever the faith from my body
Leave me begging for more
Take what I have and deliver me
Into everlasting sleep

Soothing trance
Colours fade
And disappear
Ethereal light
Showing me what I can do without

In a motionless scenes
There is only me
I take what I can
Controlling you to get ahead

Fading away
And leaving
Long for sleep
Closer now
Lead the way into death

Every wretched dream
I have left behind
Every waking hour
I lie in wait
Sucked inside by will
Gone into the flood
All my questions unfurled
As I was put to the test

Once I'm below there's no turning back

Every wretched dream
I have left behind
Every waking hour
I lie in wait

Plunging into the deepest void
Departed shell left drained behind

Pacing roads unknown
Searching for a new home
Desert in my eye
Barren lands inside

"By The Pain I See In Others"

Let me taste
Let me feel
I need to know what you keep inside
No need to speak
Just let it be
Carry out this wish for me let nothing interfere
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
Discard your clothes
Let loose you hair
We're intertwined forever and have always been
Say the word
And I'll depart
Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil

And so comes the dark
Vibrant as ever before
Flowers already withered
In this endless winter of souls
Outside in the park
The days move along
And nothing ever changes
They have nothing on us
And we've always knew
That nothing ever changes
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside
Depending on the life blood

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside

Silently
Whispering
Move in me and set me free

"The Leper Affinity"

We entered Winter once again
Naked, freezing from my breath
Neath the lid all limbs tucked away
This coffin is your abode from now and onwards

Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears

I am beyond death
Midst a dreaming affinity
Saving strength now, faint whispers
Come erotic communion in its splendour

Fever mirrored ghosts
Night time consolation, cross the line
Draw murder into art
Sleep inside through days

In the wake of this relief
Shivering, longing for more
Insanity at it's peak
Love me to my death

Lost are days of Spring
You sighted and let me in
Keep the beast inside
Shackled within my hide
Screaming out too late
Losing to my hate
Grew together with your skin
And paced the trails of sin

Your gaze covered with virgin snow
Rigid features
It's the shallow deeds who is to blame
Deafening shrieks pierced the night

A step from oblivion
Moving into the dim lights
Hiding within a reverie
It was worth it for the wait alone

Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears

"Bleak"

Beating
Heart still beating for the cause
Feeding
Soul still feeding from the loss
Aching
Limbs are aching from the rush
Fading
You are fading from my sight
Break of morning, coldness lingers on
Shroud me into nightmares of the sun

Moving
I am moving closer to your side
Luring
You are luring me into the night
Crying
Who is crying for you here
Dying
I am dying fast inside your tears

Plunging towards bereavement faster yet
Clearing thoughts, my mind is set

Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me
You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away
Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine

Help me cure you
Atone for all you've done
Help me leave you
As all the days are gone

Devious movements...

(Night falls again
Taking what's left of me!)

Slight twist, shivering corpse
Ornated with water, fills the cracks
Clasped in my limbs by tradition
This is all you need

"Harvest"

Stay with me awhile
Rise above the vile
Name my final rest
Poured into my chest

Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death, all I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr

Pledge yourself to me
Never leave me be
Sweat breaks on my brow
Given time ends now

Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death, all I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr

Spirit painted sin
Embers neath my skin
Veiled in pale embrace
Reached and touched my face

Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
(Release your grip, let me go, into the night)
Halo of death, All I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr

"The Drapery Falls"

Please remedy my confusion
And thrust me back to the day
The silence of your seclusion
Brings night into all you say

Pull me down again
And guide me into pain

I'm counting nocturnal hours
Drowned visions in haunted sleep
Faint flickering of your powers
Leaks out to show what you keep

Pull me down again
And guide me into

There is failure inside
This test I can't persist
Kept back by the enigma
No criteria is demanded here
Deadly patterns made my wreath
Prosperous in your ways
Pale ghost in the corner
Pouring a caress on your shoulder

Puzzled by shrewd innocence
Runs a thick tide beneath
Ushered into inner graves
Nails bleeding from the struggle
It is the end for the weak at heart
Always the same
A lullaby for the ones who've lost all
Reeling inside
My gleaming eye in your necklace reflects
Stare of primal regrets
You turn your back and you walk away
Never again

Spiraling to the ground below
Like Autumn leaves left in the wake to fade away
Waking up to your sound again
And lapse into the ways of misery

"Dirge For November"

Lost, here is nowhere
Searching home still
Turning past me, all are gone
Time is now

The omen showed, took me away
Preparations are done, this can't last
The mere reflection brought disgust
No ordeal to conquer, this firm slit
It sheds upon the floor, dripping into a pool
Grant me sleep, take me under
Like the wings of a dove, folding around
I fade into this tender care

"The Funeral Portrait"

You wait by the window
Morning's breath on the sill
Idle hands given another try
So you wait and you savour the moment
Outside the canvas turned white
Ruby eyes in the fog

Rain washing clean all the sins
A liquid gown that covers all
Your loathe turns endless
Opened mirage soothes your sense
Locked on the pinnacle
The best secret within

Like a derelict child
Heart burning for a stranger
Ascending to the meek
Flock round the liars in awe

Caked in the soil beneath
Fear me when we meet
Turn away in admiration
My firm grip round the nucleus of joy

Enough of this
You will leave me now
You will see it now
Perish at my hands

Close to you
Tangled up in hair
Fresh stigma looks
Shall I take you with me
And it is cold
Ruby eyes in the fog
It is me

And you are just like them all
Stained by the names of fathers
I'm greeting my downward fall
Leaving the throes to others

"Blackwater Park"

Confessor
Of the tragedies in man
Lurking in the core of us all
The last dying call for the ever lost
Brief encounters, bleeding pain

Lepers coiled neath the trees
Dying men in bewildered soliloquies
Perversions bloom round the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic under the waning moon

It is the year of death
Wielding his instruments
Stealth sovereign reaper
Touching us with ease

Infecting the roots in an instant
Burning crop of disease
I am just a spectator
An advocate documenting the loss
Fluttering with conceit
This doesn't concern me yet
Still far from the knell
Taunting their bereavement

Mob round the dead
Point fingers at the details
Probing vomits for more
Caught in unbridled suspense

We have all lost it now
Catching the flakes of dismay
Born the travesty of man
Regular pulse midst pandemonium
You're plucked to the mass
Parched with thirst for the wicked

Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark
The sun sets forever over Blackwater Park

<|endoftext|>

"Still Day Beneath The Sun"

There is a light that hits the gloom around
Shows the footprints round this grave
Dried up roses scattered on the mound
Honouring the one engraved

Will ever the morning
Carry away
The souls of those for whom we cry

Leaving, grieving
Seeking, meeting
Binding, unwinding
Sighing, "you"

Still day beneath the sun
Asking you who is the one
And when the day is late
We know who must forever wait

Black procession through the narrow aisles
Another's gone for all to see
Near the site for one who lost his trials
Sleeping neath the ground is me

"Patterns In The Ivy 2"

Without you I cannot confide in anything
The hope is pale designed in light of dreams you bring
Summer's gone, the day is done soon comes the night
Biding time, leaving the line and out of sight

One moonlit shadow on the wall
Disrupted in its own creation
Veiled in the darkness of this fall
Is this the end-manifestation

It runs in me, your poison seething in my veins
This skin is old and stained by late September rains
A final word from me would be the first for you
The rest is long but I'll go on inside and through

One moonlit shadow on the wall
Disrupted in its own creation
Veiled in the darkness of this fall
Is this the end-manifestation

Patterns in the Ivy
Patterns in the Ivy

"The Moor"

The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays

Weary from what might have been ages
Still calm with my mind at peace
Would I prosper or fall, drain the past
The lapse of the moment took it's turn

I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death-mask at birth
The hands of God, decrepit and thin
Cold caress and then nothing
I was taken away from my plight
A treason bestowed to the crowd
Branded a Jonah with fevered blood
Ungodly freak, defiler

Pale touch, writhing in the embers
Damp mud burning in my eyes
All the faces turned away
And all would sneer at my demise

Outcast with dogmas forged below
Seared and beaten, banished from where I was born
No mercy would help me on my way
In the pouring rain nothing is the same

Vows in ashes
I pledge myself to no-one
Seethed and spiteful
All shudder at the call of my name
If you'll bear with me
You'll fear of me

There is no forgiveness in these eyes
For any of you but one
Dispel the mist for now
Melinda is the reason why I've come

She is water drops over the pyre
A thistle in my hands
Stained and torn, aged and brown
Virtuous shell with kindred innocence

I awoke from the miasma
Passing swiftly through the moor
This is here, waters stir
And in the distance all that was lost
If you'll bear with me
You'll fear of me
You'd never leave me to
A fate with you

"Godhead's Lament"

Marauder
Staining the soil, midst of stillness
Beloved fraternity to an end
Red eyes probe the scene
All the same
Stilted for the beholder
Depravity from the core
Handcarved death in stoneladen aisles

I hide the scars from my past
Yet they sense my (mute) dirge
This is when it all falls apart
White hands grasping for straws

Sly smile, poisoned glare behind
Undisguised manmade nova
Mute cry, don't dare to tread
Searing beams tracking you down

Adoring what never has been
Some will bring with them all they have seen

Searching my way to perplexion
The gleam of her eyes
In that moment she knew

Thought I could not leave this place
On this imminent day
As I've reached the final dawn
To what's gone astray
What would they care if I did stay
No-one would know
What would they care if I did stay
No-one should know

Thought I could not leave this place
On this imminent day
As I've reached the final dawn
To what's gone astray
What would they care if I did stay
No-one would know
What would they care if I did stay
No-one should know

Still brooding, soothing calm
That rigid, twisted face
Blank godhead, tear my name
Lost virtue, frantic lust

Sly smile, poisoned glare behind
Undisguised manmade nova
Mute cry, don't dare to tread
Searing beams tracking you down

Adoring what never has been
Some will bring with them all they have seen

Searching my way to perplexion
In crumbling faith I saw her
Bearing her pain in the wilderness
The gleam of her eyes
In that moment she knew

"Benighted"

Come into this night
Here we'll be gone
So far away
From our weak and crumbling lives
Come into this night
When days are done
Lost and astray
In what's vanished from your eyes

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright

Come into this night
Your plight alone
Carry your weight
You are flawed as all of us
Come into this night
Your only home
It's never too late
To repent, suffer the loss

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright

Come into this night
When you're able
To undo your deeds
And atone with your lonely soul
Once you're into this night
All minds are stable
Forget all your needs
Lose the grip of all control

"Moonlapse Vertigo"

Kept warm by the light of the lantern
Lost sight of everything tonight
My presence blackens their pattern
A pock in the healthy and calm

Their scorn behind your back
My promise would put them down
No trace of reverence left
Immemorial fire in their eyes

I would perish at the given signal
At the slightest touch from my soul
Tainted prophet in flesh
For all the plagued and lost

Dripping sin
Decision in stalemate
Dare to feel death at hand
Surprised me with its voice
Through the forest came the morn

Across the leafy pathway
Their deeds smeared in blood
For all to behold
The council of the cross
Must have sensed my coming
The pest through the air
With despise for squalor
Lashing out at the poor

I turned away my eyes
In pallor escape from the end
Fading time to leave from here
And less to fulfill my task
She would be safe and firm
Nothing of this is in vain
Taken away from stifling grace
And saved from the past

<|endoftext|>

"Face Of Melinda"

By the turnstile beckons a damsel fair
The face of Melinda neath blackened hair
No joy would flicker in her eyes
Brooding sadness came to a rise

Words would falter to atone
Failure had passed the stepping stone
She had sworn her vows to another
This is when no-one will bother

And conceded pain in crumbling mirth
A harlot of God upon the earth
Found where she sacrificed her ways
That hollow love in her face

Still I plotted to have her back
The contentment that would fill the crack
My soul released a fluttering sigh
This day fell, the darkness nigh

I took her by the hand to say
All faith forever has been washed away
I returned for you in great dismay
Come with me, far away to stay

Endlessly gazing in nocturnal prime
She spoke of her vices and broke the rhyme
But baffled herself with the final line
My promise is made but my heart is thine

"Serenity Painted Death"

Returned from a hibernal dream
Voices fell like marble
No longer by my side
Gone all that would linger

Ripped from my embrace
Melinda reflected in shafts
Red line round her neck
Met the earth in silence

Pale

White faced, haggard grin
This serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath

White faced, haggard grin
This serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath

Saw her fading, blank stare into me
Clenched fist from the beautiful pain

Darkness reared its head
Tearing within the reeling haze
Took control, claiming my flesh
Piercing rage, perfect tantrum
Each and every one would die at my hand
Choking in warm ponds of blood
At last, weak and torn, I went down
Drained from strength, flickering breath

Came with the moon
The wayward in conscious state
Flanked and barred in destiny's end
Underneath with hope in latches
Swathed in filth, any would betoken
Starlit shadows on the wall
Finally there to collect me
From the bowels of sin

<|endoftext|>

"White Cluster"

Still it came passing by
The pieces weaved together rose the sun
And fooled me with another day
The knocking message called for my life

Sealed the spell of my scrawny body
Soil to skin, my next of kin
Damp air grasped, stole the words
And greeted me with a hiss

This is forgiveness, so I know
Once I repent I seal the lid
I slither for you and I'm dying
I find trust in hate

They wear white for me
Seemingly jaded and lost
I forge myself into your dreams
And here I am your life

Hangman, clutching at his tools
I will come for you

The noose is tied
Murmur through the crowd
Plunging into anywhere but here

Cloak-captured sighs of relief
As the primal touch brought me back
And the last sight I did see is still here
Beckoning right behind me

"Prologue"

[Instrumental]

A morning in magenta, the petals fed from the dew.
She held her breath for a moment, to pause off the stream.
Still clinging to vast, old memories.
And I would marvel at her beauty, playing through the rain.
The coffin is beautifully engraved.
Stained by soil, symbols of death.
All of which are stared upon, with porcelain eyes it seems.
Some spoke, and it was my turn to go.
In death entwined, I could not believe.
But it hangs around my neck.
A soft breeze passed me by, somewhat warmer for a second.
I knew it was the coming of spring, thus our APRIL ETHEREAL.

<|endoftext|>

"April Ethereal"

It was me, peering through the looking-glass.
Beyond the embrace of Christ.
Like the secret face within the tapestry.
Like a bird of prey over the crest.
And she was swathed in sorrow, as if born within its mask.

Her candlelight snuffed, the icon smiled.
Emptiness followed by her wake.
I could clasp her in undying love.
Within ghostlike rapture the final word was mine.

She faced me in awe. 'twas a token of ebony colour.
Embodied in faint vapour.
Wandering through April's fire.
Compelled to grasp and to hold the one that was you.

I will endure, hide away.
I would outrun the scythe, glaring with failure.

It is a mere destiny I thought, a threshold I had crossed before.
The rain was waving goodbye, and when the night came
the forest folded its branches around me.
Something passed by, and I went into a dream.
She laughing and weeping at once: "take me away".

I don't know how or why, I'll never know WHEN.

<|endoftext|>

"When"

Red sun rising somewhere through the dense fog.
The portrait of the jaded dawn who had seen it all before.

This day wept on my shoulders.
Still the same as yesterday.
This path seems endless, body is numb.
The soul has lost its flame.
Walking in familiar traces to find my way back home.

So there I was.
Within the sobriety of the immortals.
A semblance of supernatural winds passing through.
The garden sighs, flowers die.

The gate was closed that day, but I was bound to carry on.
She could not see me through the windows.
In dismay, strangest twist upon her lips.
Graven face, she said my name.

Once inside I heard whispers in the parlour.
The gilded faces grin, aware of my final demise.

And I cried, I knew she had lied.
Her obsession had died, it had died.

When can I take you from this place?
When is the word but a sigh?
When is death our lone beholder?
When do we walk the final steps?
When can we scream instead of whisper?

When is the new beginning,
the end of this sad MADRIGAL.

<|endoftext|>

"Madrigal"

[Instrumental]

Our abode 'mongst the stars is waiting,
long enough for our last breath of life.
You stare at nothing, right through me,
at times resembling the Devil's concubine.
And me, I am the idol that would long
to caress our eyes until they would open no more.
I would comfort you if I only could,
but as we all know by now... I am just thin air.
Unaware as you are of my presence,
you are losing yourself.
Hiding within THE AMEN CORNER.

<|endoftext|>

"The Amen Corner"

White summer.
So far I have gone to see you again.
Hiding your face in the palm of your hands.
Finding solace in the words I do despise.

You snatch at every sound.
And even though you believe that I am shackled within death,
memories are tainted with paleness.
Crestfallen still.
Those eyes... empty like a barren well.

It was the only task I would undertake.
To reap the harvest that was mine.
The seed that had sprung into a florid meadow,
and left me helpless in your embrace.
The bond we never spoke of, once stark and enticing,
now slowly smoldering to dust.

The celestial touch, from grey to black.
A fathomless void enclosing.
Unwritten secrets beneath the cobwebs.
I can not endure.

And so I rose from my sleep.
The moon turned away its face.
Overture of the long, black night begins...
something you said: "Eerie circles upon the waters".

Until now we have shared the same aura.
My ashes within your hands.

My breath in the sepulchral mound.
You know that your night is my day.
The final spark that blew life into me,
the DEMON OF THE FALL.

<|endoftext|>

"Demon Of The Fall"

Silent dance with death.
Everything is lost.
Torn by the arrival of Autumn.
The blink of an eye, you know it's me
You keep the dagger close at hand.

And you saw nothing.
False love turned to pure hate.
The wind cried a lamentation
before merging with the grey.

Demon of the fall.

Gasping for another breath.
She rose, screaming at closed doors.
Seductive faint mist forging
through the cracks in the wall.

I shant resist.
In tears for all of eternity.
She turned around and faced me for the first time.

Run away, run away.
Just one second, and I was left with nothing.
Her fragrance still pulsating through damp air.
That day came to an end.

And she had lost in me, her CREDENCE.

<|endoftext|>

"Credence"

Deserted again.
You speak to me through the shadows.
Walking in closed rooms, using cold words.
Captured by the night.
The yearning escapes from my embrace.

Strange silhouettes whisper your thoughts, scream your sadness.
And they all turned away,
unable to face more of this death.

Credence in my word.
Written in dust, tainted by memories.
I confess my hope, recognize my loneliness.

Your laughter weeps the truth.
Push me into corners.
Confirming the epitaph of my soul
and displaying the once unknown KARMA.

<|endoftext|>

"Karma"

And as they say, grief is only able to possess.
The rotting body clad in ancient clothes
is left behind with a wave of the hand.

I have gone away. The bed is cold and empty.
Trees bend their boughs toward the earth.
And nighttime birds float as black faces.

It was the hand reaching out through the mirror.
Unknown and scarred by life...
the luring eyes, you had never seen.

You have nothing more to find.
You have nothing more to lose.

The cold season drifts over the land.
They huddle in the brown corners.

Some would settle for less.
The castles were all empty, asleep.
Long awaiting their king.
Beckoning round the bend.

Amidst the forest one would hear that I had been there.
Draped within a fate I could not change,
and always welcoming Winter's EPILOGUE.

<|endoftext|>

"Epilogue"

[Instrumental]

There it was.
The final destiny.
A sunrise that never came,
still the night lamp that never faded away.
Farewell was the word,
and the afterglow was the brave morning.
Rising and telling everyone
about the beauty of its PROLOGUE.

"Circle Of The Tyrants"

[Celtic Frost cover]

After the battle is over
And the sands drunken the blood
All what there remains
Is the bitterness of delusion

The immortality of the gods
Sits at their side
As they leave the walls behind
To reach the jewels gleam

The days have come
When the steel will rule
And upon his head
A crown of gold

Your hand wields the might
The tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will
As the morning is near

I sing the ballads
Of victory and defeat
I hear the tales
Of frozen mystery

The new kingdoms rise
By the circle of the tyrants
In the land of darkness
The warrior, that was me
Grotesque glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and war
Are like everlasting shadows

Where the winds cannot reach
The tyrant's might was born
And often I look back
With tears in my eyes
Grotesque glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and wars

<|endoftext|>

"Remember Tomorrow"

[Iron Maiden cover]

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of the fire.

Tears for rememberance, and tears for joy,
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of the fire.

<|endoftext|>

"Advent"

It was all true
A parlour strode, and the night sets forever
I stray in the quiet cold
And you gird me when I dare to listen

Elastic meadow, endless arms of sorrow
Lips try to form "because"
Trying to adapt to the wilderness
Where even foes close their eyes and leave

We are inside the glade
Every now and then I wipe the dust aside
To remember...

How I drape my face with my bare hands
The same that brought me here
But you were beyond all help
The folded message that wept my name

Shadows skulk at my coming
We survey the slopes
In search for the words to write the missing page
The tainted dogma

Time grows short
As the piper plays his tune
We are almost there

You are beyond all help
Dancing into the void
We are almost there

<|endoftext|>

"The Night And The Silent Water"

And so you left us
Jaded and gaunt, some September
Wilted with the seasons
But hidden inside the delusion
I saw your eyes somewhere

Devoid of death
The aura poises amidst (the storm)
In solid tears I linger
A parlour glade, moonlit sorrow

Lonely resting pools
Relics of the moon-dogged lake
Whisper, "All your words are misgiven."

Am I like them?
Those who mourn and turn away
Those who would give anything
To see you again
If only for another second

Your face was, like the photograph
Painted white
We did not speak very often about it
What does it matter now?

Cloak of autumn shroud
I gaze, dim ricochet of stars
I reckon it is time for me to leave

You sleep in the light
Yet the night and the silent water
Still so dark

<|endoftext|>

"Nectar"

I arose from the lullaby
Enduring yet another tale
You tempt me again
With your embrace, so tainted
Within the night you beckon
Cursing me with every glance

Bring me through
Carry my empty shadow
And guide me inside your warped labyrinth
To the well of sin
I swear I will always love you

Leave me speechless
Release my yearning
The soil I walk is clad with light
Drifting moons thrust me with their rays
And I fall inside

I lament this heritage
Cannot bid farewell
The pale face...you went as far as you could
And from that moment
I witnessed your beauty, felt your death

Mine is yours, mine is yours

In the wake of dawn
The mist of morning linger before it leaves
Invisible eyes, red reflection
It is you
Smiling in the midst of the moor

<|endoftext|>

"Black Rose Immortal"

In the name of desperation
I call your name
A lamentation I sigh
Again and again

Spiritual eclipse
The gateways are closed for me to seek

The night...
A veil of stars, watching
My shadow is born from light
The light of the eye, in darkness

Over troubled waters memories soar
Endlessly, searching night and day
The moonlight caresses a lonely hill
With the calmness of a whisper

I wear a naked soul
A blank face in the streaming water
It is cold in here
Frost scar my coat with dust

Eyes attach to your mute portrait
We spoke only through thoughts
Together we gazed, awaited
Hours brought thirst and the rising sun

Sunbirds leave their dark recesses
Shadows glide the archways

Do not turn your face towards me
Confronting me with my loneliness
You are in a forest unknown
The secret orchard
And your voice is vast and achromatic
But still so precious

Lullaby of the crescent moon took you
Mesmerized, its kaleidoscopic face
Granted you a hollow stare
Another soul within the divine herd

I have kept it
The Amaranth symbol
Hiddin inside the golden shrine
Until we rejoice in the meadow
Of the end
When we both walk the shadows
It will set ablaze and vanish
Black rose immortal

It is getting dark again
Dusk shuffle across the fields
The evening trees moan as if they knew
At night I always dream of you

<|endoftext|>

"To Bid You Farewell"

I am awaiting the sunrise
Gazing modestly through the coldest morning
Once it came you lied
Embracing us over autumn's proud treetops

I stand motionless
In a parade of falling rain
Your voice I cannot hear
As I am falling again

Devotion eludes
And in sadness I lumber
In my own ashes I am standing without a soul
She wept and whispered: "I know..."

We walked into the night
Am I to bid you farewell?

Why can't you see that I try
When every tear I shed
Is for you?

"Eternal Soul Torture"

[2000 re-issue bonus track]

The deceased awake from beyond their sleep.
Search for blood and mortal meat.
Maggots crawl out from their eyes.
Feel their pain, it's mournful cries.
Pull your veins, tear out your heart.
Consume the blood, feast on flesh.
Torn apart, intestines scattered.
Alimentary canal ripped and shattered.
Pieces of your body eaten.
Painful death as time stands still.
Where your mind bursts in torture.
Feel your soul be torn apart.
Demons crawling through your system.
Hell has risen, the gods of pain.
Rip your skin, burn your bones.
Internal organs torn and drained.
Smell of flesh burnt to ashes.
Cries of death from hell.
Pain is all you revolve around.
Where the souls of Satan's grounds.
Rooms of eternal torture, reveal endurance of endless pain.
Disintegrating mortals, bodies burn.
There you feel the hellish torture.
Hellish torment, brutal butchering.
Demonic creatures revolve in torment...

"In The Mist She Was Standing"

Seven milestones...
Under a watching autumn eye
Contorted trees are spreading forth
The message of the wind

With frozen hands I rode with the stars

With anger the wind blew
Giving wings to my stallion
Clouds gathered across the moon
Blazing the white light

Passing the lake I know so well
I am near, yet so far away

Arrival...
I saw her shadow (standing) in the darkness
Awaiting me like the night
Awaits the day
Standing silent smiling at my presence
A black candle holds the only light

Darkness encloses
And the candle seem to expire
In her cold, cold hand
And as a forlorn soul
It will fade away

Touching her flesh in this night
My blood froze forever
Embraced before the dawn
A kiss brought total eclipse

And she spoke
Once and forever
I am so cold
In mist enrobed the twilight
She was standing...

<|endoftext|>

"Under The Weeping Moon"

Once again I've cried
Unto the moon
That burning flame
That has guided me
Through all these years
The lake from which you flow

With eyes of fire
Once unlit but now alive
This energy, sparkling
Like a morning star

The morning star

Riding the fires of
The northern gold
I've searched the eye
I laugh under the weeping moon

I am the watcher in the skies
Nor the emeralds know my mark
Glisten to mark their presence
Set the enigma ablaze
Searching...
Finding...

Burn the winter landmarks
That said I was there
Burn the spirit of cold
That travel through my soul

<|endoftext|>

"The Forest Of October"

The memories that now rests in this forest
Forever shadowing the sunrise of my heart
Wings leave their nest at my coming
Swaying away unto the cold glowing sky
Dreaming away for a while
My spirit sighs in peace
Gazing unto the stars
Please, take me there

I am so alone, so cold
My heart is to scarred to glow
I wish the sunrise to come
Take my soul (away)
From this cold, lonely shell
I am free

From the eternal sea I rose
Veiled in darkness on either shore
Lost my pride, lost its glow
For me the sun rose no more

The forest of October
Sleeps silent when I depart
The web of time
Hides my last trace

My blaze travel the last universe
Like the sights of magic
Wrapped in aeons
My mind is one with my soul
I fall alone
While leaves fall from the weeping trees

<|endoftext|>

"The Twilight Is My Robe"

Unto you I whisper
The wildest dreams

In the coldness of night

Shrouded in crystals
Through a frosty dusk
Souls of the fullmoon awaits
Their shadows ablaze

We are all bending
Our tired leaves over your empty shell
In the sign of true esteem
Are you beloved lord
Sighing deep under these waterfalls?

The birds of the sun
Seperates these dark clouds
While the winds of winter sleeps gently around
I am sworn to the oath
To breathe...

At the waters I dwell
The waves are still whispering
Ancient lullabies
I die....
While our mystic brothers still seek

Under your command I will obey
In my vision
You are the embodiment of pure freedom
But through my eyes you are made of stone

<|endoftext|>

"The Apostle In Triumph"

In solitude I wander....
Through the vast enchanted forest
The surrounding skies are one
Torn apart by the phenomenon of lightning
Rain is pouring down my (now) shivering shoulders
In the rain my tears are forever lost

The darkened oaks are my only shelter
Red leaves are blown by the wind
An ebony raven now catches my eye
Sitting in calmness
Before spreading his black wings
Reaching for the skies

In this forest
Where wolves cry their agony unto the moon
My spirit is hidden
In the form of wisdom
carved on a black stone
The only way to follow

Open your soul
Redeem, I am immortal

Blinded by a light
My soul is held up in glory
I engulf the skies
The apostle in triumph

Through the eternal flame I travel
As the rain keeps falling....

"Harridan"

Gold man bites down on a silver tongue
Takes a deep breath and blows the candle out
He knows the truth but he keeps it to himself
Here it is
You can only save yourself
Only yourself

When we bite the dust
We will hide our cuts from the world
When you're in the dirt
You don't show your hurt to the world
When we bite the dust
We will hide our cuts from the world
When you're in the dirt
You don't show your hurt to the world

Cold man, white knuckles on the wheel
Well it's all just there to steal
You just gotta take it
Take it like the harridan you are

When we bite the dust
We will hide our cuts from the world
When you're in the dirt
You don't show your hurt to the world

It's the time of the almost rain without you
I am in debt to night
And gone to earth for love
And I, a shadow
And what of us?
And what of me?
And what is left without you?

When we bite the dust
We will hide our cuts from the world
When you're in the dirt
You don't show your hurt to the world

And gone to earth for love
And I, a shadow

"Of The New Day"

Hold your fear in check my dear
It's got no place here
There's no need to fight
Just drift away on the new day

Find yourself a better way
To meet the future
It's all that you crave
A silhouette of the new day

Walk away from what you love
And all your people move into fog
But live again on the new day

Raise your head and fill your lungs
Breathe the autumn
Shame to be down
In this thrall of the new day

The hour of almost rain
When night becomes the day

Daily finds you tearing out
All the pages
That held all your thoughts
When you dreamed of the new day

It's not the world that shrinks from you
It's the old days
That line up behind
The monolith of the new day

The hour of almost rain
When night becomes the day

"Rats Return"

Leave your principles at the door
Spare me
Purge your guilt for the nameless hoards
Thrill me, you clown

You always beat the system somehow
Now the rats return to take their bow

A dog wakes inside the carnivore
A heart bleeds
A conscience won't help you to win the war
So fool me, you fraud

You always beat the system somehow
Now the rats return to take their bow

"Dignity"

Lost boy
With the shreds of your shoes on your feet
And the schoolgirls called you a freak
Long gone
With all that you are in a bag
(Watching you fumble)
And a paper cup held in your hand

You have your pride, you're standing your own ground
Your dignity will never go, and your mind is pretty sound
You stare at the sun
You screw up your face, and then you're done

Lost soul
Camped at the side of the road
And the rain rises up through your toes
Brave man
With the egg running down past your nose
(The future was yours, how it came to this no one knows)
All the troubles you've had, no one knows
(Nobody knows)

You have your pride, you're standing your own ground
Your dignity will never go, and your mind is pretty sound
You stare at the sun
You screw up your face, and then you're done

Outside where the traffic cowers
And the past begins to fade away
Tell yourself it's just what the thunder said
So pack up your belongings and stop talking with yourself

All the friends I have, I made you a list
Even if it's true, they don't all exist

(All the friends I have, I made you a list
Even if it's true, they don't all exist)

Slack jaw
Will you tell me of all that you were?
And the promises you made to her
Drink up
You can tell me of all that you've seen
While we wait for the light to turn green

You have your pride, you're standing your own ground
Your dignity will never go, and your mind is pretty sound
You stare at the sun
You screw up your face, and then you're done

Hey, did you curse this place?
Did you fall to earth to cull the herd?
Strange gods above the earth
These things you just won't believe

In the shackles of the night
There are lights up in the sky
Scratching at the doors
They are coming through the walls
20 feet above the ground
They move without a sound
Among the garbage cans
A curse upon the land

"Walk The Plank"

This ship is now under water
And the rats will never find their way back again
And my span, it gets shorter (1, 2, 3)
And I don't appear to my fit my skin anymore

Somewhere else descends the rain in western ways
Upon the echo of the day
Just the ebbing of the day

See how
They hang 'em high
And slap each other's backs
While the waters rise

Somewhere else descends the rain in western ways
Upon the echo of the day
Just the ebbing of the day

Walk the plank, abandon ship
Take it slow, don't lose your grip
Walk the plank and jump out of the fray

Walk the plank, abandon ship
Take it slow, don't lose your grip
Walk the plank and jump out of the fray

Walk the plank, abandon ship
Take it slow, don't lose your grip
Walk the plank and jump out of the fray

A coat of arms is all we are

A sinkhole for the crawling of the hours

Afraid to be (afraid to be) what I should be (what I should be)
The sum of all (the sum of all), of new and old (of new and old)
Experience has made me none the wiser

I'm afraid to be happy and I
Couldn't care less if I was to die, oh

Chimera's wreck around my neck
To start again, to dream again
To fix the things that cursed me from the start

My father smiles (my father smiles); me, the child (me, the child)
Getting tired (getting tired), losing drive (losing drive)
The clarity that age has brought to me

[?] for tomorrow
Even when the rain comes, we can still find a future in tomorrow

"Never Have"

You need, but you'll never have
You dreamed, but you never had the chance to be
What you wanna be
You grasp, but you never hold
You ask, but you're never told
'Cause the truth hurts
This is the modern world

So you bide your time
With your fate resigned
To be paid in kind

You reach, but you never get
You breathe, but you never let the past go
Do you ever learn?
You search, but you never find
You hurt, but you never try to face facts
This is the modern world

So you bide your time
With your fate resigned
To be paid in kind
When the flashbulb dies
And the humdrum thrives
Do you lose your pride?

You need, but you'll never have
You dreamed, but you never had the chance to be
What you wanna be
You grasp, but you never hold
You ask, but you're never told
'Cause the truth hurts
This is the modern world

"Love In The Past Tense"

One hundred rooftops stretch
Across a crowded skyline in relentless melt
The smog and cigarettes
Poisoning the well for those below alone

You beautiful young soul
I bend to you forever and I trust in you
I lose all self-control
Lay the nest with feathers
Wave goodbye to youth
(Love in the past tense)

Falling back to earth
We get what we deserve
Strength to split the sky
What is born will die
In time
Love in the past tense

We always end up here (We always end up here)
Where nothing feels the same and all our dreams capsize
We ran out of ideas (We ran out of ideas)
And hold each other's promise for one final time
(Love in the past tense)

Falling back to earth
We get what we deserve
Strength to split the sky
What is born will die
In time
Love in the past tense

(Love in the past tense
Love in the past tense)
Love in the past tense
Love in the past tense
(Love)

"The Blind House"

If you wanna stay
Always here
All these years
The last frontier
It's no concern of theirs
The world outside
Corrupts my child
So trust these eyes

Faith is in your soul
But in these walls
Hormones stall
Dogs will crawl
The vices and the doubt
We resist
All this shit
So kneel submit

Free love
Free love
Feel love in all my sisters
Breathe out
Blind house
You don't need to know their secrets
Believe me

Pray and violate
Abuse your trust
False gods must
Purge their lust
A family that lies
To seal your fate
To take the weight
Of their self-hate

Free love
Free love
Bring love to all my sisters
Breathe out
Blind house
You don't need to know their secrets
Believe me

Breathe out
Blind house
Free love
Feel loved

"Great Expectations"

A summer day
In garlands I feel secure
A useless faith
That I will get you, somehow

Reach out, I wonder where you are now

Hey, there's you
With placid eyes
Oblivious to what's to come

They locked you up
So I forgot you
Forgot your name, so strange
I wonder if you got out

<|endoftext|>

"Kneel And Disconnect"

Kneel and disconnect
And waste another year
Fill the application
Start a new career

Kneel and disconnect
And waste another year
Fill the application
Start a new career

"Drawing The Line"

Camphor crossed with lace, it is the witching hour
Cinematic but crude
Teasing all my feelings out, you move away
It seems so natural to you

Still siren, climbing up the victory tower
Like there's something left to prove
I trap the beads of sweat that run between my eyes
And free the fever to move

I'm drawing the line, I'm drawing the line
I'm drawing the line, I draw the line
And I have my pride
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
And I save my soul
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
And I have no doubt

Dreamt the sound of scissors, cutting stitches out
Then discarding the used
Recording all my problems onto memory cards
Your compassion unmoved

Onto others what they always do to you
The most twisted of your rules
Distill malaise and photograph the hole it leaves
Running out a copy for you

I'm drawing the line, I'm drawing the line
I'm drawing the line, I draw the line
And I have my pride
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
I'm taking control, I'm taking control
And I save my soul
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
I'm shutting you out, I'm shutting you out
And I have no doubt

"The Incident"

At junction 8 the traffic starts to slow
Artilleries of braking lights and bluish glow
Ascending in a plumage of twisted steel
Shattered glass and confetti dashed upon the wheel

When a car crash gets you off you've lost your grip
When a fuck is not enough you know you've slipped
When the church is full it means you've just been had
When the world has gone to seed you're so detached

Got a feeling that I want you to be there

Driving by on my way to somewhere else
I fill my lungs with a noxious burning smell
There is weed and grey concrete like this for miles
Dead souls in my rear view mirror hitch a ride for a while

I want to be loved

<|endoftext|>

"Your Unpleasant Family"

Your unpleasant family,
smashed up my car
(perfectly uncalled for)

Your unpleasant family,
how vile they are
(I crawled out of the wreckage on my knees)

It's alright my flower
so what did we learn?
(there I found regret amongst the trees)

Snaps of a life,
We had in the garden,
We tear up the flowers

<|endoftext|>

"Time Flies"

I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced?

Into a suburb of heaven
Yeah, it should've been forever
It all seems to make so much sense

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
'Cause time flies

She said luck is all you make it
You just reach out and take it
Now let's dance a while

She said nothing ever happens
If you don't make it happen
And if you can't laugh then smile

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
'Cause time flies

And laughing under summer showers
Is still the way I see you now

How does time break down
With no marker, things slow down.
A conference of the strange
And your family is deranged

I could tell you what I'm thinking
While we sit here drinking
But I'm not sure where to start

You see there's something wrong here
I'm sorry if I'm not clear,
Can you stop smoking your cigar?

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
'Cause time flies

And the coat your wore to Alton Towers
It's still the way I see you now

"Octane Twisted"

We go following sorrow to feel your
Blood spilling out of the reeds there
Give me a sign I can breathe air
Blood flowing out of the stream there

(give me something new please, something I can love)

<|endoftext|>

"The Seance"

Under gas light the joining of hands
Chanting a name over and over

A table tilts the circle is broken
Doubting no more
They pay what they owe her

Disembodied a luminous hand
Holding the air, passing the current
A voice is channeled, a rope is uncoiled
Flicker the light
And someone is here

We go following sorrow to feel your
Blood spilling out of the reeds there
Give me a sign I can breathe air
Blood flowing out of the stream there

(give me something new please, something I can love)

<|endoftext|>

"I Drive The Hearse"

When this freedom stains my coat
With the winter in my throat
When I'm lost I dig the dirt
When I fall I drive the hearse

And silence is another way
Of saying what I wanna say
And lying is another way
Of hoping it will go away
And you were always my mistake...

Given time I fix the roof
Given cash I speak the truth

And silence is another way
Of saying what I wanna say
And lying is another way
Of hoping it will go away
And you were always my mistake...

When I'm down I drive the hearse

When this boredom wears me out
Then the sky begins to cloud
Sleeping with my ball and chain
When she cries I take the blame

And pride is just another way
Of trying to live with my mistakes
Denial is a better way
Of getting through another day
And silence is another way
Of saying what I wanna say
And lying is another way
Of hoping it will go away
And you were always my mistake...

When I'm down I drive the hearse

"Flicker"

Nothing is new here underneath the sun
All of the big new charlatans will sneer at us
Barely a flicker of the light to come
Only the people who always think they know best

Nothing is new here underneath the sun

"Bonnie The Cat"

Can't feel the pain that I expected
I still place keys in the ignition
I know what will be
One thought is stopping me from sleeping
I saw the future and it's breeding
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

There are three things that I would die for
But I am sure you're not one of them
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

[Whispered:]
You think you've got it all wrapped up now
You stumble on so unsuspecting
I know what will be)

I hold your birth control to ransom
The cells divide and grow inside you
I know what will be

I know what will be

I know what will be

<|endoftext|>

"Black Dahlia"

You have no interest in the past
Where you came from
Where you're going to

There's a cliche in your eye
File the edges down
Soon be underground

There's nothing here for you under the sun
There's nothing new to do, it's all been done
So put your faith in another place

Never seem to get away from this
It's all falling into an abyss
So put your foot on the pedal boy

All you know is secondhand
The bullet passed through the cage inside you

You stole the only thing you love
So unfaithful, the drop is fatal

<|endoftext|>

"Remember Me Lover"

I didn't want to feel like a slave to your mood swings
And I'm not saying anything I wouldn't say behind your back
And all this shit could have happened to anyone
All that matters now is how you gonna pick it up to throw it back

It's so hard to get along
I always know what you're gonna say
This too: I hated you
I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut

I never meant to start anything that I couldn't finish
Now I gotta be the one to turn away, it's time to react
I meant every word that I said, yeah I really did
But you gotta understand that I was sleeping then
So relax

I walked away, now remember me lover
I told you lies, now remember me lover
I took your money, remember me lover
I ruined your life, now remember me lover

It's so hard to get along
I always know what you're gonna say
This too: I hated you
I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut

I've been through this with you about a hundred times
Agree to disagree, start again, with our lives
Then every single morning I wake up and you're still there
But tomorrow you will be alone and that is all you deserve

I walked away, now remember me lover
I told you lies, now remember me lover
I took your money, remember me lover
I ruined your life, now remember me lover

It's so hard to get along
I always know what you're gonna say
This too: I hated you
I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut

"Fear Of A Blank Planet"

Sunlight coming through the haze
No gaps in the blinds
To let it inside
The bed is unmade,
Some music still plays

TV, yeah it's always on
The flicker on the screen
A movie actress screams
I'm basking the shit flowing out of it

I'm stoned in the mall again
Terminally bored
Shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting is getting so last year's thing

X-Box is a god to me
A finger on the switch
My mother is a bitch
My father gave up ever trying to talk to me

Don't try engaging me
The vaguest of shrugs
The prescription drugs
You'll never find a person inside

My face is Mogadon
Curiosity has given up on me
I'm tuning out desires
The pills are on the rise

How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here

I'm through with pornography
The acting is lame
The action is tame
Explicitly dull
Arousal annulled

Your mouth should be boarded up
Talking all day with nothing to say
Your shallow proclamations
All misinformation

My friend says he wants to die
He's in a band, they sound like Pearl Jam
Their clothes are all black
The music is crap

In school I don't concentrate
And sex is kinda fun, but just another one
Of all the empty ways of using up the day

How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here

Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with this boredom
Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with this boredom

You don't try to be liked
You don't mind
You feel no sun
You steal a gun
To kill time

You're somewhere
You're nowhere
You don't care
You catch the breeze
You still the leaves
So now where?

<|endoftext|>

"My Ashes"

All the things that I needed
And wasted my chances
I have found myself wanting

When my mother and father
Gave me their problems
I accepted them all

Nothing ever expected
I was rejected
But I came back for more

And my ashes drift beneath the silver sky
Where a boy rides on a bike but never smiles
And my ashes fall over all the things we said
On a box of photographs under the bed

I will stay in my own world
Under the covers
I will feel safe inside

A kiss that will burn me
And cure me of dreaming
I was always returning

And my ashes find a way beyond the fog
And return to save the child that I forgot

And my ashes fade among the things unseen
And a dream plays in reverse on piano keys

And my ashes drop upon a park in Wales
Never-ending clouds of rain, and distant sails

<|endoftext|>

"Anesthetize"

A good impression of myself
Not much to conceal
I'm saying nothing
But I'm saying nothing with feel

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining please

Because of who we are
We react in mock surprise
The curse of "there must be more"
So don't breathe here,
Don't leave your bags

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining please

The dust in my soul
Makes me feel the weight in my legs
My head in the clouds
And I'm zoning out

I'm watching TV
But I find it hard to stay conscious
I'm totally bored
But I can't switch off

Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV, cod philosophy

We're lost in the mall
Shuffling through the stores like zombies
What is the point?
What can money buy?

My hand's on a gun
And I find the range, God tempt me
What did you say?
Think I'm passing out

[x2]
Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV, cod philosophy

Water so warm that day (water so warm that day)
I counted out the waves (I counted out the waves)
As they broke into shore
I smiled into the sun

The water so warm that day
I was counting out the waves
And I followed their short life
As they broke on the shoreline
I could see you
But I couldn't hear you

You were holding your hat in the breeze
Turning away from me in this moment
You were stolen as black across the sun

Water so warm that day (water so warm that day)
I counted out the waves (I counted out the waves)
As they broke into shore (as they broke into shore)

"Sentimental"

I never wanna be old
And I don't want dependents
It's no fun to be told
That you can't blame your parents anymore.

I'm finding it hard to hang from a star
I don't wanna be...
Never wanna be old.

Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way wish away each day

I don't really know
If I care what is normal
And I'm not really sure
If the pills I've been taking are helping

I'm wasting my life
Hurting inside
I don't really know
And I'm not really sure...

[x2]
Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way wish away each day

"Way Out Of Here"

Out at the train tracks I dream of escape
But a song comes onto my iPod
And I realize it's getting late

I can't take the staring and the sympathy
And I don't like the questions,
"How do you feel?"
"How's it going in school?"
"Do you wanna talk about it?"

Way out, way out of here
Fade out,
Fade out, vanish

I'll try to forget you
And I know that I will
In a thousand years
Or maybe a week

I'll burn all your pictures
Cut out your face

The shutters are down and the curtains are closed
And I've covered my tracks
Disposed of the car

And I'll try to forget even your name
And the way that you look when you're sleeping,
And dreaming of this

Way out, way out of here
Fade out,
Fade out, vanish

<|endoftext|>

"Sleep Together"

This means out
This is your way out
Do or drown
Do or drown in torpor

Leave no trace
All my files erased
Burn my clothes
Burn my Prada trainers

Let's sleep together right now
Relieve the pressure somehow
Switch off the future right now
Let's leave forever

This is fate
This is your escape
Leave here now
Leave here like it's over

Let's sleep together right now
Relieve the pressure somehow
Switch off the future right now

Let's leave forever

"Deadwing"

And something warm and soft just passed through here
It took the precious things that I hold dearer
It rifled through the grey and disappeared
The creeping darkness makes the small hours clearer

Like a cancer scare
In the dentist's chair
Sucking in the air
Wire across the stair
Kicking down the door
At your local store
With the world at war
Voices through the floor
Unexpected news
Wearing high heeled shoes
Blowing out the fuse
Paying all your dues
Deadwing lullaby
Like a fracture tied
It's a worthless lie
To the public eye

I don't take waifs and strays back home with me
My bleeding heart does not extend to charity

Yes I'd have to say I like my privacy
And did you know you're on closed circuit TV? So smile at me

And a dream you had
Of your mum and dad
On a beach somewhere
And the poison air
With the cancer threat
In a cigarette
Deadwing lullaby
Find a place to hide

And from the yellow windows of the last train
A spectre from the next life breathes his fog on the pane
I look with you into the speeding black rain
Afraid to touch someone, afraid to ask her for her name

And in the morning when I find I have lost you
I throw a window open wide and step through

<|endoftext|>

"Shallow"

I don't remember
Did something in my past create a hole?
Don't use your gender
To drive a stake right through my soul

I live to function
On my own is all I know
No friends to mention
No distraction, nowhere to go

Shallow, shallow Give it to me
Scissors cutting out your anger
Shallow, shallow No good to me, not if you bleed
Bite your tongue, ignore the splinter

This city drains me
Well maybe it's the smell of gasoline
The millions pain me
It's easier to talk to my PC

<|endoftext|>

"Lazarus"

As the cheerless towns pass my window
I can see a washed out moon through the fog
And then a voice inside my head, breaks the analogue
And says

"Follow me down to the valley below You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"

I survived against the will of my twisted folk
But in the deafness of my world the silence broke
And said

"Follow me down to the valley below You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"

"My David don't you worry
This cold world is not for you
So rest your head upon me
I have strength to carry you"

(Ghosts of the twenties rising Golden summers just holding you)

"Follow me down to the valley below You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
Come to us, Lazarus
It's time for you to go"

<|endoftext|>

"Halo"

God is in my fingers God is in my head
God is in the trigger God is in the lead

God is freedom, God is truth
God is power and God is proof
God is fashion, God is fame
God gives meaning, God gives pain

You can be right like me
With God in the hole you're a righteous soul
I got a halo round me, I got a halo round me
I'm not the same as you
Cos I've seen the light and I'm gaining in height now
I got a halo round me, I got a halo round me
I got a halo round my head

God is on the cell phone God is on the net
God is in the warning God is in the threat

"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here"

Never stop the car on a drive in the dark
Never look for the truth in your mother's eyes
Never trust the sound of rain upon a river
Rushing through your ears

Arriving somewhere but not here

Did you imagine the final sound as a gun?
Or the smashing windscreen of a car?
Did you ever imagine the last thing you'd hear as you're fading out was a song?

All my designs, simplified
And all of my plans, compromised
All of my dreams, sacrificed

Ever had the feeling you've been here before?
Drinking down the poison the way you were taught
Every thought from here on in your life begins
And all you knew was wrong?

Did you see the red mist block your path?
Did the scissors cut a way to your heart?
Did you feel the envy for the sons of mothers tearing you apart?

<|endoftext|>

"Mellotron Scratch"

A tiny flame inside my hand
A compromise I never planned
Unravel out the finer strands

And I'm looking at a blank page now
Should I fill it up with words somehow?

I whispered something in her ear
I bare my soul but she don't hear

The scratching of a mellotron
It always seemed to make her cry
Well maybe she remembers us
Collecting space up in the sky

Nothing rises from my feet of clay, but it's OK
Red mist spreads across my fingertips, ardour slips

I lay her gently on my clothes
She will leave me yes I know

And I'm looking at a blank page now
Should I fill it up with words somehow?

The scratching of a mellotron
It always seemed to make her cry
Well maybe she remembers us
Collecting space up in the sky

Nothing rises from my feet of clay, but it's OK
Red mist spreads across my fingertips, ardour slips

Don't look at me with your mother's eyes or your killer smile
Sing a lullaby

Don't look back into black
Don't let the memory of sound drag you down
To end as friends so painful
Don't look down
Shut it down

<|endoftext|>

"Open Car"

Nothing like this
Felt in her kiss
Cannot resist her
Fell for her charm
Lost in her arms
I keep a photograph
Give me a glimpse
Let me come in
Be there inside her
Here it begins
Here is the sin
Something to lie about

You think you're smart
I think you're art
We agree on this
It doesn't work
Feeling like dirt
Feeling like you don't care
We get a room
And in the gloom
She lights a cigarette
Clothes on the bed
Love me she said
I lose myself to her

I'm getting feelings
I'm hiding too well
(Bury the heart shaped shell)
Something broke inside my stomach
I let the pieces lie just where they fell
(Being with you is hell)

Hair blow in an open car
Summer dress slips down her arm
Hair blown in an open car

OK what's next?
After the sex
What do we now?
Finding the time
Drawing the line
And never crossing it
Gave her the hours
Gave her the power
Cannot erase her
Gave her the truth
Gave her the proof
I gave her everything

I'm getting feelings
I'm hiding to well
(Bury the heart shaped shell)
Something broke inside my stomach
I let the pieces lie just where they fell
(Being with you is hell)

Hair blow in an open car
Summer dress slips down her arm
Hair blown in an open car
On a drive out to the farm
Hair blown in an open car

Hair blown in an open car
Summer dress slips down your arm
Hair blown in an open car.

"The Start Of Something Beautiful"

Always in my thoughts you are
Always in my dreams you are
I got your voice on tape, I got your spirit in a photograph
Always out of reach you are

Cold inside my arms you are
Simple like a child you are
I remember when you took my hand and led me through the rain
Down inside my soul you are

The more I show the way I feel
The less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know
The less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent
Forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful?
Well think again.

Mother lost her looks for you
Father never wanted you
I trust to love and then I find you never really felt the same
There's something in your heart so cruel

<|endoftext|>

"Glass Arm Shattering"

Feeling all your touching
Feeling all your blood
Feeling all your touching
Feeling all your love

Seen it through a windscreen
Seen it through the glass
Seen it in a bad dream
Seen it in your heart

<|endoftext|>

"She's Moved On"

You move in waves
You never retrace
Your newest craze
Straight out of the Face by the bed unread

I'm left behind
Like all the others
Some fall for you
It doesn't make much difference if they do

She changes every time you look
By summer it was all gone - now she's moved on
She called you every other day
So savour it it's all gone - now she's moved on

So for a while
Everything seemed new
Did we connect?
Or was it all just biding time for you?

"Blackest Eyes"

A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make up runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my urges bled
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
Swim with me into your blackest eyes

A few minutes with me inside my van
Should be so beautiful if we can
I'm feeling something taking over me

<|endoftext|>

"Trains"

Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hiss of the train at the railway head

Always the summers are slipping away

A 60 ton angel falls to the earth
A pile of old metal, a radiant blur
Scars in the country, the summer and her

Always the summers are slipping away
Find me a way for making it stay

When I hear the engine pass
I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides
I'm in luck

When the evening reaches here
You're tying me up
I'm dying of love
It's OK

"Lips Of Ashes"

Paralysed
Lips of Ashes
Synchronised
Blue vein crashes

Touching you inside

Idolised
Black Eyes fading
You and I
Connection failing

I drill down inside

<|endoftext|>

"The Sound Of Muzak"

Hear the sound of music
Drifting in the aisles
Elevator Prozac
Stretching on for miles

The music of the future
Will not entertain
It's only meant to repress
And neutralize your brain

Soul gets squeezed out
Edges get blunt
Demographic
Gives what you want

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world that no one cares
No one cares enough

Now the sound of music
Comes in silver pills
Engineered to suit you
Building cheaper thrills

The music of rebellion
Makes you wanna rage
But it's made by millionaires
Who are nearly twice your age

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world that no one cares
No one cares enough

"Gravity Eyelids"

Open your eyes now
Hear me out before I lose my mind
I've been waiting for hours
Let the salt flow, feel my coil unwind

Give me a smile please
Count the calm and watch my breathing slow
Winding me up tease
Get inside my head and make it show

Gravity eyelids come down

Touching your oil skin
Slipping hands down past your waist to find
I've been waiting for hours
Let the salt flow, feel my coil unwind
Go to the edge swim
Brown the eyes that sleep has rendered blind

Gravity eyelids come down
Come love so young with your gold arms so I wake her
Here's a will that will glow in the dark

<|endoftext|>

"Prodigal"

I don't know whose side I'm on
I don't think that I belong round here
If I left the stage would that be wrong?

I tried to find myself a better way
I got religion but I went astray
They took my money and I lost my faith

Rain keeps crawling down the glass
The good times never seem to last
Close your eyes and let the thought pass

I tried the capsule and I tried the smoke
I tried to aid escape like normal folk
But I never seemed to get the joke

These are my old clothes
This is a new low
This is my blood flow
This is my headstone

I spend my days with all my friends
They're the ones on who my life depends
I'm gonna miss them when the series ends

Rain keeps crawling down the glass
(Pull yourself together)
The good times never seem to last
(You know it's not so bad)
Close your eyes and let the thought pass
(Close your eyes and let it pass)

"The Creator Has A Mastertape"

He captured and collected things
And he put them in a shed
He raised a proper family
So he could tie them to a bed

The creator had a mastertape
But he left it in a cab
I stared into the void tonight
The best dream I ever had

He worked himself into the ground
And drove a spike into his head
A voice said "Are you happy now?'
Your sordid home is running red

Pills and chloroform
All the pages torn

<|endoftext|>

"Heartattack In A Layby"

I pull off the road
East of Baldock and Ashford
Feeling for my cell
In the light from the dashboard

Hissing from the road
The smell of rain in the air con
Maybe check the news
Or just put a tape on

Lighting up a smoke
I've got this feeling inside me
Don't feel too good

If I close my eyes
And fell asleep in this layby
Would it all subside
The fever pushing the day by

Motor window wind
I could do with some fresh air
Can't breathe too well

(She waits for me. Home waits for me.)

I guess I should go now
She's waiting to make up
To tell me she's sorry
And how much she missed me
I guess I'm just burnt out
I really should slow down
I'm perfectly fine but
I just need to lie down

We'll grow old together
We'll grow old together
We'll grow old together...

"Strip The Soul"

This is my home, this is my own, we don't like no strangers
Raise the kids good, beat the kids good and tie them up
Spread it wide, my wife, my life, push the camera deeper
I can use, I abuse, my muse, I made them all

This machine
Is there to please
Strip the soul
Fill the hole
A fire to feed
A belt to bleed
Strip the soul
Kill them all

They are not gone, they are not gone, they are only sleeping
In graves, in ways, in clay, underneath the floor
Building walls, overalls, getting bored, I got faulty wiring
Brick it up now, brick it up now, but keep the bones

(Do you want a western home in the rubble?)

"Collapse The Light Into Earth"

I won't shiver in the cold
I won't let the shadows take their toll
I won't cover my head in the dark
And I won't forget you when we part

Collapse the Light Into Earth

I won't heal given time
I won't try to change your mind
I won't feel better in the cold light of day
But I wouldn't stop you if you wanted to stay

Collapse the Light Into Earth

"Drown With Me"

So you have been of use
And you have been abused
You know you look pale today
Your lipstick has gone astray
You sold out and lost your looks
You gave away all your books
(You should drown with me)
Your coil has been wound up tight
Unwind it with me tonight
(You should drown with me)
Tyre tracks Fresh on the ground
Where she will be found
Held under the water
Resting there in a stream
View from the cold water
Buried in green
Orange filter sky
Your drowning in family there
When will you come up for air
(You should drown with me)
Don't feel you let 'em down
Cos they have already drowned
(You should drown with me)

<|endoftext|>

"Chloroform"

Little retrograde, wonder where you are
Another motorcade, under radar
A boy in borrowed clothes, knows he is a girl
Shards of light come down, stillness in the air
Big sleeper, your deeper, too deep for me yeah
Speak clearer, can't hear you, I'm going under
On the mountain side, hold me in your gaze
But it's over now, cos I got kids to raise

<|endoftext|>

"Futile"

You were the one that made her cry
You were the one that told her lies
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
Neither an adult or a child

Now it only moves you forward
And back to the blackness at the same time
Burnt out tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
Futile
You were the one collecting space
You were the one just saving face
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
Neither an adult or a child

Now it only moves you forward
And back to the blackness at the same time
Burnt out tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
Futile

"Buying New Soul"

Dried up, a guitar upon my knee
I should have sold out when the devil came for me
Dig a hole and throw it out to sea
Break the code, how happy I could be

I still wave at the dots on the shore
And I still beat my head against the door
I still rage and wage my little war
I'm a shade and easy to ignore

White wall, I had to paint a door
I always find that I've been through it before
Close it up and throw away the key
Break the code, how happy I could be

I woke up and I had a big idea
To buy a new soul at the start of every year
I paid up and it cost me pretty dear
Here's a hymn to those that disappear

<|endoftext|>

"Access Denied"

Access denied
All of the smarter kids they stay inside
But out in the pouring rain
You're kicking me with that look of sheer disdain

The fat controller man
He doesn't understand he's my biggest fan
So I'll stay here on the floor
It's better to be ignored than to be adored

Church spires ticking
Hose pipes hissing

Don't want to smother you
Just want you to be the mother of my children (now)
And you do

Good morning lucky man
I hope you enjoyed your sojourn in Japan
It's such a perfect scene
Back here in Golders Green - cut...end of dream

<|endoftext|>

"Cure For Optimism"

Up there a mountain rises
Down here an ocean dives
A stranger with a head full of lead
Photographs me

Steel bars and a doctor's note
Don't give up
They can plead and beg but don't let them fix your head

Outside a path to knowledge
Inside a waste of cells
A serpent with a mobile phone
Sweet talks me

<|endoftext|>

"Disappear"

We made the world believe we didn't care
We gate crashed parties and just stood and stared
We moved to London and stayed in all year
Standing next to you I disappear

You made a choice for us to live it up
I've got a voice inside me saying give it up
Let's get out of here, let's find a new career
You be famous, and I'll disappear

I erase myself again [3x]

I need security, you favour chance
I ponder everything while you advance
You bring the world to me and I just sneer
In your shadow I disappear

I erase myself again
I erase myself again
(I'm here)
I erase myself again
(I'm here, you're never standing still)
(I'm here)
I erase myself again
(I'm here, you're never standing still)

I'm here, I'm here, you're never standing still [4x]

"In Formaldehyde"

Dust in the kitchen
Coffeepot
Microdots

Now we are coasting
Talking less
Breathing stress

Somewhere inside
I have died
So I will lie
In formaldehyde
People walk
Through my insides

When I get out of here
I get a plastic vase
And you get to keep the car

Or do you want me to stay ?
The things that I have to say
You've heard it all anyway

Send me to sleep
You always could
Fatherhood

Tie up loose ends
Make it stop
Forget me not

And would you really mind
If I told you a millionth time
The story of my decline ?

You never seem to take
The time to contemplate
Before you annihilate

"Even Less (Full Version)"

A body is washed up on a Norfolk beach
He was a friend that I could not reach
He thought I was cold but I understand
But for the grace of God goes another man

And I may just waste away from doing nothing
But I'm a martyr to even less

A choir boy is buried on the moors
Where we used to go dreaming when we were bored
Some kids are best left to fend for themselves
And others were born to stack shelves

And I may just waste away from doing nothing
But I'm a martyr to even less

Fuck you and your book too
You can have it back
When I'm gone these songs will
Will be my tracts

And I had a stupid dream that I could change things
But I'm a martyr to even less

I hate the ground that I have walked upon
Nothing I've done has ever mattered long

"Lightbulb Sun"

The sun is a light bulb
A candle's a treat
The curtains stay closed now
On my little retreat
And I'll only take medicine
If it's followed by sweets
A sickly pink liquid
That puts me to sleep

My head beats a better way
Tomorrow a better day

And I can watch TV
While I'm wrapped up in bed
And mother makes sure that
I'm watered and fed
My best friend from school will
Come over and stare
At me in my bubble
Of germified air

When I'm asleep the smoke fills me
I feel the heat
My illness leaves me

The sun is a light bulb
A candle's a treat
The curtains stay closed now
On my little retreat
But after a while
The noise from the street
Is making me wish I
Was back on my feet

"How Is Your Life Today?"

The letters pile up in the hallway
Junk mail and bills from the catalogues
And the neighbours have guessed 'cos I've cancelled the milk
And they don't hear your voice through the walls anymore

How is your life today ?

I was kissed on the cheek by a cold mouth
While the taxi was waiting like a getaway car
Each second seems like a lifetime
And the cat it's been staring at me all this time

How is your life today ?

<|endoftext|>

"Four Chords That Made A Million"

Six of one a half a dozen
Black guitars and plastic blues
Hide behind a wall of nothing
Nothing said and nothing new

4 Chords that made a million

You belong there on the cover
You are the emperor in new clothes
A man who thinks he owns the future
Will sell your vacuum with his prose

4 Chords that made a million

And then a moron with a cheque book
Will take you out to lunch who knows ?
He will tell you you're a saviour
And then he'll drop you like a stone

4 Chords that made a million

And I have tried and I have died
Trying to get through
But in the end I can't defend you.

4 Chords that made a million

"Shesmovedon"

You move in waves
You never retrace
Your newest craze
Straight out of the Face by the bed unread

I'm left behind
Like all the others
Some fall for you
It doesn't make much difference if they do

She changes every time you look
By summer it was all gone - now she's moved on
She called you every other day
So savour it it's all gone - now she's moved on

So for a while
Everything seemed new
Did we connect ?
Or was it all just biding time for you ?

"Last Chance To Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycled"

[a) Winding Shot (Summer 1981)]

If you fall asleep with me
You can dream and drowse
The miuntes turn to hours

We could climb a tree or two
And watch the sun go down
Upon our sleepy town

After all the time I spent with you
Summer went away
And we just weren't the same

It's just you and me alone
Not grown ups but not kids
You kissed me on the lips

"The Rest Will Flow"

I was pretending to be floating strong
But I was sinking
In to still water

Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow

Then out of darkness I found I could still feel
Something good
Out of the woods

Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow

One simple thing that I never could see
But now I know
All of the rest will flow

Stay with me my angel I found you
Now I don't feel low
All of the rest will flow

Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow

"Hatesong"

This is a hate song just meant for you
I thought that I'd write it down while I still could
I hope when you hear this you'll want to sue

Oh it's a lonely life in my empty bed
And it's a quiet life that leaks from my head
These are the last rites
The line is dead

Yes, I'm hearing voices too
And I'm more cut up than you

<|endoftext|>

"Where We Would Be"

Tied - tied to a time
When we knew that the sun would shine
And you were all smiles
And we could just talk for a while...

Of where we would be when the future comes
And how you would paint while I wrote my songs

If I could find you
And tell you about my life
Or maybe just write
And remind you of when we would dream...

Of where we would be when the future comes
And how you would paint while I wrote my songs

Strange how you never become
The person you see when you're young

"Russia On Ice"

You think I deserve this
You said I was stupid
All my thoughts are like coal
But Russia on ice is burning a hole

Can't stop myself drinking
Can't stop being me
If I call will you come and will you save me?

I see the whole thing come down
I burn it to the ground
Well what the hell did you say?
You said you hate me this way
It's just a matter of time

A drop in the ocean
A significant motion
Nothing melts in this cold
But Russia on ice is burning a hole

"Feel So Low"

So see how long I can last
You can pretend that I don't exist for you
And I can laugh about it now
But I hated every minute
I was waiting for your email
And each day that you forgot to call
Just made me feel so low
So low

Christmas 1998
I tried to call
I just couldn't wait
And your message was out of date
So I left my voice on your machine
But you did not respond
OK OK OK you've won
You make me feel so low
So low

"Piano Lessons"

I remember piano lessons
The hours in freezing rooms
Cruel ears and tiny hands
Destroying timeless tunes

She said there's too much out there
Too much already said
You'd better give up hoping
You're better off in bed

You don't need much to speak of
No class, no wit, no soul
Forget you own agenda
Get ready to be sold

I feel now like Christine Keeler
Sleepwaking in the rain
I didn't mean to lose direction
I didn't want that kind of fame

(Take your hands off my land)

Credit me with some intelligence
(if not just credit me)
I come in value packs of ten
(in five varieties)

And even though I got it all now
My only stupid dream
Is you and me together
And how it should have been

I remember piano lessons
Now everything seems clear
You waiting under streetlights
For dreams to disappear

"Pure Narcotic"

You keep me waiting
You keep me alone in a room full of friends
You keep me hating
You keep me listening to the Bends

No amount of pointless days
Can make this go away

You have me on my knees
You have me listless and deranged
You have me in your pocket
You have me distant and estranged

No narcotics in my brain
Can make this go away

I'm sorry that, I'm sorry that I'm not like you
I worry that I don't act the way you'd like me to

You find me wanting
You find me bloodless but inspired
You find me out
You find me hallucinating fire

No narcotics in my brain
Can make this go away

Have we ever been here before?
Running headlong at the floor
Leave me dreaming on a railway track
Wrap me up and send me back

<|endoftext|>

"Slave Called Shiver"

I need you more than you can know
And if I hurt myself it's just for show
I found a better way to curb the pain
You put a trigger here inside my brain

Mother I need her
I'm falling apart
Mother I need her
And it's only the start

I may be nothing now but I will rise
I'll have more followers than jesus christ

Through all the smashing things and crashing cars
I love the ground you walk with all my heart

"Don't Hate Me"

A light snow is falling on London
All sign of the living has gone
The train pulls into the stations
And no-one gets off and no-one gets on

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't fight me
I know you'll never care
Can I call you on the telephone, now and then?

One light burns in a window
It guides all the shadows below
Inside the ghost of a parting
And no-one is left, just the cigarette smoke

Don't hate me
I'm not special like you
I'm tired and I'm so alone
Don't fight me
I know you'll never care
Can I call you, I'm terrified

"This Is No Rehearsal"

How many children did I bring into this world?
How many did I lose in the shopping arcade?

This is no rehearsal - play it back
and throw things at the screen
This is no rehearsal - somebody
interpret this for me

And still I remember how I dressed him this morning
And then he was gone - stolen, my only one

"Baby Dream In Cellophane"

I am - in my pram
Look you - I'm so new I am - sleeping there
Underneath the stairs

If you - wanted to
You'd find - inside my mind
Things so surreal
My lips are sealed

In the rain in cellophane
Pale dogs and demigods
They won't bring me down
The cogs go round, they never stop

I've been - in limousines
I've seen - inside your dreams
It's raining there
Try not to stare

"Stranger By The Minute"

Ghosts in the park
Appear just after dark
Killers, children ...
But no-one has a harp
They look like tourists
It makes me want to laugh

Under floorboards
It's hard to fly a kite
Underwater
My cigarette won't light
Standing in the shade
I'm getting frostbite

Strange as I seem
I'm getting stranger by the minute
Look in my dream
It's getting stranger by the minute

When I'm drowning
You drag me up to you
Rings in the water
My only residue
But you're just fiction
And I'm a twisted boy

<|endoftext|>

"A Smart Kid"

Stranded here on planet earth
It's not much but it could be worse
Everything's free here, there's no crowds

Winter lasted five long years
No sun will come again I fear
Chemical harvest was sown

And I will wait for you
Until the sky is blue
And I will wait for you
What else can I do?

A spaceship from another star
They ask me where all the people are
What can I tell them?

I tell them I'm the only one
There was a war but I must have won
Please take me with you.

"Stop Swimming"

This song leaks out onto the pavement
It could be a joke, it could be a statement
The more that I fake it and pretend I don't care
The more you can read in to what isn't there

Maybe it's time to stop swimming
Maybe it's time to find out where I'm at
What I should do and where I should be
But no-one will give me a map

I'll leave now this can't continue
But I forget which door I came through
And I know that the lift can be painfully slow
So I think I'll leave by the window

"The Sleep Of No Dreaming"

At the age of sixteen
I grew out of hope
I regarded the cosmos
Through a circle of rope
So I threw out my plans
Ran on to the wheel
And emptied my head
Of all childish ideals
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
I married the first girl
Who wasn't a man
And smiled as the spiders
Ran all over my hands
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
Made a good living
By dying it's true
As the world in my TV
Leaked onto my shoes
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming

"Waiting - Phase One"

Waiting... to be born again

Wanting... the saddest kind of pain
Waiting for the day when I will crawl away

Nothing is what I feel
Waiting... for the drugs to make it real
Waiting... for the day when I will crawl away

Waiting... to be disciplined
Aching... for your nails across my skin
Waiting... for the day when I will crawl away

"Sever"

Telepath Carbon trapped under stone
Brother mother pale body is thrown
Only way I know to have fun
Fill up my blood, my veins, my lungs

ESP city - rainy and blue
Burn down this town, I give it to you
Aero shallow, photograph blind
Stage fright, black light, coma divine

No sense of time
Sever tomorrow
Exitless mind - ESP Sever tomorrow

School out invective, losing my voice
Film shredding on in multiple choice
America calls, I must go
Oprah saviour, I feel that low

"Every Home Is Wired"

Modem load and failsafe
Electric teenage dust
Hit the solvent keypad
Start the neural rust

Power on the highway
Data in my head
Surfing on the network
Part of me is dead

Every Home is Wired

Swimming in the circuit
Somebody has expired
This world will be the future

Every home is wired

<|endoftext|>

"Dark Matter"

Inside the vehicle the cold is extreme
Smoke in my throat kicks me out of my dream
I try to relax but its warmer outside
I fail to connect, it's a tragic divide

This has become a full time career
To die young would take only 21 years
Gun down a school or blow up a car
The media circus will make you a star

Dark matter flowing out on to a tape
Is only as loud as the silence it breaks
Most things decay in a matter of days
The product is sold the memory fades

Crushed like a rose
In the river flow
I am I know

<|endoftext|>

"I Find That I'm Not There"

We lost the skyline
We stepped right off the map
Drifted in to blank space
And let the clocks relapse

We laughed the rain down
Slow burn on the lawn
Ghosts across the delta
Swallowed up the storm

Sometimes I feel like a fist
Sometimes I am the colour of air
Sometimes it's only afterwards
I find that I'm not there

In the dream dusk
We walked beside the lake
We watched the sky move sideways
And heard the evening break

<|endoftext|>

"Stars Die"

The moon shook and curled up like gentle fire
The ocean glazed and melted wire
Voices buzzed in spiral eyes
Stars dived in blinding skies

Stars die. Blinding skies.

Tree cracked and mountain cried
Bridges broke and window sighed
Cells grew up and rivers burst
Sound obscured and sense reversed

Stars die. Blinding skies.

[Spoken:]
Hello, Neil and Buzz.
I´m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made from the White House.
I just can´t tell you how proud we all are of what you have done.
For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives.
Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man´s world.
And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.

Idle mind and severed soul
Silent nerves and begging bowl
Shallow haze to blast away
Hyper sleep to end the day

Stars die. Blinding skies.

<|endoftext|>

"Dislocated Day"

A dislocated day
Peers in to the ether
Counts the stars inside the sky
And flies in to the never

Looped around my eyelids
A thousand shining flecks
Pale against the canvas
Which hangs around my neck

Dislocated day
I will find a way
To make you say
The name of your forgiver

Stood beside an inlet
A starfish leads a dance
It dreams it is a human
And falls into a trance

A hole inside my body
Is wired up to a charge
Chemical imbalance
Tells me who you are

Insects hide the silence
November brings deep rain
Between the flow to freezing
And yesterday's sustain

<|endoftext|>

"The Moon Touches Your Shoulder"

Springtime is over
Don't head for home
Creep up the ladder
And steal over stone

No time to forget this
World's in your eyes
Sway in the cloud blur
And light up the sky

Cast off the colour
And tune in to black
The moon touches your shoulder
And brings the day back

<|endoftext|>

"Synesthesia"

I'm sending you a letter
Because I don't think there's much time
Time to clear the cobwebs
Time to bear the crime

It's only a number
It's only a death
Another soldier died in action
The telegram regrets

I'm lying on a stretcher
They're lying to my face
There's no-one left to help me
I'm just a waste of space

It's a matter of moments
I'll be dead before you've read
There's blood on the table
And my back is full of lead

<|endoftext|>

"Always Never"

I feel no pain
Cos I'm an island
I will remain
In the deafness of your silence

I love you sometimes
Always Never
He said you're here
Here with me now

I feel no gain
When you're around me
I'll try again
In the darkness you astound me

It's growing cold
I'm growing old
Is this the only way to see the fire?
It's raining...

<|endoftext|>

"Up The Downstair"

Sleep
Until the colours dissolve
Leave the dream to rain-soak forever
In blessed moments
Viewed from trains of half-truths

Monuments burn into moments
Up into other worlds
Other ascensions
Without deep sorrow to endure

Black Sunday of sleep
Open for small angel escapes
Moved by buildings to tears
They week in the rain
Am I at home?
Am I in heaven?
Gentle Architecture

<|endoftext|>

"Small Fish"

The first thing that I saw as,
the fisherman smiled at me
Were empty people dressed in grey,
floating out to sea
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
The small fish gave a cry

The next thing that I saw as,
things were fading fast
Were dreams of children's laughter,
smouldering to dust
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
The small fish gave a cry

The last thing that I saw as, my life passed by
Were fields of empty people, laying down to die
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
To watch the burning sky.

<|endoftext|>

"Fadeaway"

I sat in the room with a view
The girl in the photograph knew
Can't you see?
Why is she laughing at me?

I stumbled through the dark unaware
The face in the hall isn't there
Tomorrow has gone
Where do the voices come from?

Watching the leaves as they blew
Lost in the room with a view
Climb the walls
You did not know me at all

I fell through a hole in the floor
The audience cried out for more
Fadeaway
It's just another day

Hit heaven far too high.

<|endoftext|>

"Jupiter Island"

Jupiter Island is full of pleasures
Glowing gardens holding hidden treasures
Luminous flowers of yellows and greens
Glittering petals that have to be seen
Here's your chance don't let it pass you by
Take my hand and we'll fly

Jupiter Island is surrounded by oceans
Majestic ballerinas with graceful motions
Magenta forests on a crimson sea
The electric clouds are as vivid as can be
Scarlet moons in a domino sky
Take my hand and we'll fly

Come on let's fly to Jupiter Island
Just take my hand and we'll fly

Jupiter Island is full of mountains
Ruby rivers and sapphire fountains
Chessboard lawns bible black and white
The pink and blue trees are incredibly bright
An orange sunset painted on the sky
Take my hand and we'll fly

Jupiter Island is full of people
But you can't see them unless you want to
Lying in the hay on a hot sunny day
Everyone's happy so no-one's gay
Laughter from the children dances way on high Take my
hand and we'll fly

Jupiter Island is full of meadows
Fertile pastures for growing rainbows
Illuminated portraits from strange orchestrations
Lost in a collage of its own creations
Never a chance to wave goodbye
Take my hand and we'll fly

"The Nostalgia Factory"

A Caterpillar crawled to me one day and said
"Oh what the hell goes on inside your swollen head?
I don't believe that you can see as much as I
Now close your eyes and tell me what do you say?"

"I watched nine cats dance on the moon
A flamingo stalked into my room
It bowed its head to me and knelt
To reveal the cards it had dealt
An ace, three jacks, two queens, four kings
Then turned them into burning rings
The flames jumped out and chased four mice
Caught by their tails they turned to ice

A cloud appeared outside my door
And through the window saw four more
And on the back of each cloud sat
Two rainbow smiles in wizard's hats
They threw five clocks down on my bed
The chimes danced out on golden threads
And turned to footprints on my wall
Sequined tears began to fall"

The caterpillar gasped at me and said
"My god if that's what's going on inside your head
You can see so much more than I
I think it's time to turn into a butterfly."

<|endoftext|>

"Space Transmission"

You must listen very carefully to what I have to say.
There isn't much time, because You Know Who
has consumed all the instruments.

For many eons now I have been trapped on this planet.
He is keeping me here against my will, and sometimes
when I press my ear up very close to the concrete
I can hear his daughters sobbing with laughter.
Either I am blind, or I have been in darkness
ever since the sun exploded fourteen centuries ago.

A few hours ago, He Who Keeps Me Here visited me saying,
"God, why do the millions worship you instead of I �
am I not more powerful, more forgiving and truly compassionate?"

A black liquid was seeping uncontrollably from my mouth
and all I could do was babble incomprehensibly
about a dream I had many moons ago.
In it, a clock ticked constantly, maddening my senses.

That was all, but it lasted for many days
until each tick seemed like fragments of glass piercing my scales.
He Who Keeps Me Here tells me that one day I will return to earth,
and then I will seek my revenge.

<|endoftext|>

"Radioactive Toy"

Run through forests on a hot Summer day
Trying to break down walls of numbing pain

Give me the freedom to destroy
Give me radioactive toy

Taste the water from a stream of running death
Eat the apple and cough a dying breath

Feel the sun burning through your black skin
Pour me into a hole, inform my next of kin

Run through graveyards on a dusty Winter day
Spit the dirt out and try to say...

<|endoftext|>

"Nine Cats"

The butterfly sailed on the breeze
Past a field of barbed wire trees
Where golden dragons chased around
Pampered poppies on the ground
Two silver trout sat way on high
And watched a royal samurai
Plant two black orchids in a box
And strap it to a laughing fox
A minstrel bought a crooked spoon
He gave it to a blue baboon
Who filled it full of virgin snow
And watched it in the afterglow

Fat toad stood in his ballet shoes
Teaching sixteen kangaroos
How to skip across a lake
They found it hard to stay awake
A pharaoh played a merry tune
And watched nine cats dance on the moon
I didn't know what all this meant
I didn't know why I'd been sent.

The Insignificance version of Nine Cats has the
following additional verse at the end:

I threw 5 clocks down on my bed
The chimes danced out on golden threads
And turned to footprints on my wall
Sequined tears began to fall

<|endoftext|>

"Footprints"

I saw her footprints on the sea
I knew her eyes were watching me
So I ventured further in my mind
In the hope that I would find:

"Tangerine Trees and Marmalade Skies and
Plasticine Porters with Looking Glass Ties"

My mind had formed a mental prison
I cried aloud no-one would listen
Then floating through the heavy mist
My vision took a sudden twist

Empty people stood in grey
Children laughing far away
An empty courtyard wept alone
Rain lashed down on darkened stone

A crystal glove points to the door
A threshold I had crossed before
On turning back all I could see
Were her footprints on the sea.

"Linton Samuel Dawson"

Linton Samuel Dawson
Lives in inner space
He hangs around with a circus troupe
Outside the human race

Linton Samuel Dawson
Has just reached 25
Artists travel from outside time
Just to see his rainbow jive

He's bored, He's bored.

Linton Samuel Dawson
Yields his knowledge in a phial
A vivid play on an emerald day
I s experienced in his smile

Linton Samuel Dawson
Visits many open minds
He aids escape to tranquility
From the boredom of mankind

Boredom. From the boredom.
From the boredom of mankind.

"And The Swallows Dance Above The Sun"

I'm sitting in the concrete
I'm listening for a heartbeat
I'm sitting in the painting
I promised I'd be waiting
I'm sitting in the window
I'm listening to the wind blow
I'm sitting in an hour glass
I'm waiting for the march past

I'm sitting in the doorway
I'm wishing for a new day
I'm choking in the landscape
I'm cutting through the red tape
I'm sitting in the concrete
I'm listening for a heartbeat

And the joke has crossed the line
And the final word is mine
And the mist has touched the wood
And the words are understood
And the sand has drifted high
And the blind man gave a cry
And the swallows dance above the sun
And the swallows dance above the sun
Yeah

I'm sitting on the ceiling
I had to know the feeling
I'm sitting in the shelter
I'm going down helter skelter
I'm sitting in the concrete
I'm listening for a heartbeat

Every time I turn around
There's another face watching me
Every time I turn around
There's another voice calling me
Every time I turn around
There's another fool reading me
Every time I turn around
There's another silence drowning me

"The Long Silence"

A systematic killer
Returning from Madrid
Murdered Mozart in his garden
Mussolini ran and hid
He was chosen by his elders
Sitting on the shelf
They passed his heart to Satan
Who showered them with wealth

A Purple Haze crawled on the lawn
Where lonely angels played
And Shakespeare wrote of Vietnam
While a president decayed
Hollow laughter from below
Cracked the sky in two
As Manson dance inside the flames
And the yellow changed to blue

Swinging from a length of rope
Ruth Ellis blew a kiss
Merlin spoke to Norma Jean
And granted her a wish
Mark Chapman stared at fantasy
Bare wires burned his brain
As Sergeant Pepper led the band
Playing through the rain

The third eye on the surface
Opens up my mind
Twin visions in production
This long silence you will find

<|endoftext|>

"It Will Rain For A Million Years"

I locked myself inside the capsule
And watched the planet slowly turning blue
The lights before me flashed and sparkled
Holding keys to lives I've wandered through
Circuits buzzing, visions passing
Mysterious and cold upon the screen
Glowing, flowing with the currents
Yet never knowing where I've really been

The floating seeds of timeless travel
Come to rest in planes that don't exist
Visiting worlds of crystal beauty
Offering dreams so very hard to resist
I've seen the past, I've seen the future
Beyond dimension and into empty space
Finding questions, never answers
living time behind another face

<|endoftext|>

"Fear Inoculum"

Immunity, long overdue
Contagion, I exhale you
Naive, I opened up to you
Venom and mania
Now, contagion, I exhale you

The deceiver says, he says
You belong to me
You don't wanna breathe the light of the others
Fear the light, fear the breath
Fear the others for eternity
But I hear them now, inhale the clarity
Hear the venom, the venom in
What you say inoculated
Bless this immunity
Bless this immunity
Bless this immunity

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Enumerate all that I'm to do
Calculating steps away from you
My own mitosis
Growing through division from mania

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Forfeit all control
You poison, you spectacle
Exorcise the spectacle
Exorcise the malady
Exorcise the disparate
Poison for eternity
Purge me and evacuate
The venom and the fear that binds me

Your veil now, lift away
I see you runnin'
Deceiver chased away
A long time comin'

"Pneuma"

We are spirit
Bound to this flesh
We go around one foot nailed down
We're bound to reach out and beyond
This flesh become Pneuma

We are will and wonder
Bound to recall, remember
(We are born of)
One breath, one word
(We are all)
One spark, sun becoming

Child, wake up
Child, release
The light
Wake up now, child, wake up

Wake up now, child

Reach out and beyond
Wake up, remember

One breath, one word

One spark, eyes full of wonder

"Invincible"

Long in tooth and soul
Longing for another win
Lurch into the fray
Weapon out and belly in

Warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Bellow aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am

Beating chest and drums
Beating tired bones again
Age-old battle, mine
Weapon out and belly in

Tales told
Of battles won
Of things we've done
Caligula would grin

Beating tired bones
Tripping through, remember when
Once invincible
Now the armor's wearing thin
Heavy shield down

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Relevant

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Cry aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am

Struggling
To remain
Relevant

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Tears in my eyes, chasing Ponce de León's phantoms
So filled with hope, I can taste mythical fountains
False hope, perhaps, but the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting, feeling time, bearing down

"Descending"

Free fall through our midnight
This epilogue of our own fable

Heedless in our slumber
Floating nescient we free fall through this boundlessness
This madness of our own making

Falling isn't flying
Floating isn't infinite

Come our end suddenly
All hail our lethargy
Concede suddenly

To the quickened
Dissolution pray
We mitigate the ruin
Calling all to arms and order

Drifting through this boundlessness
This madness of our own making

Sound our dire reveille
Rouse all from our apathy

Lest we cease to be

Stir us from our
Wanton slumber
Mitigate our ruin
Call us all to arms and order

Sound the dread alarm through the primal body
Sound the reveille
To be or not to be

Rise
Stay the grand finale
Stay the reading of our
Swan song and epilogue

One drive to stay alive
Elementary. Muster every fiber
Mobilize
Stay alive

Stir us from our
Wanton slumber
Mitigate our ruin
Call us all to arms and order

"Culling Voices"

Disembodied voices deepen my suspicious tendencies
Conversations we've never had
Imagined interplay
Psychopathy. Don't you dare point that at me

Heated altercations we've never had, so I'm told
Yet guided by them all
Every single one

Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over and over

Judge, condemn, and banish any and everyone
Without evidence
Only the whispers from within

Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over

Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over and over

(Imaginal interplay, Imaginal interplay)
(Psychopathy) Don't you dare point that at me

(Don't you dare point that at me)
(Don't you dare point that at me)
(Don't you dare point that at me)
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you dare point that
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you dare point that at

"7empest"

(Keep calm, keeping it calm, keep calm. Fuck, here we go again)

Heat lighting flash, but don't blink. Misleading
Tranquility ruse
You're gonna happen again
That's what I think
Follow the evidence
Look it dead in the eye
You are darkness
Trying to lull us in, before the havoc begins, into a dubious state of serenity
Acting all surprised when you're caught in the lie

We know better
It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you
We know your nature

Blame it all on the bastards when you're blowing out
Shame on you
Shame on you now
No amount of wind could begin to cover up your petulant stench and demeanor
Calm as cookies and cream, so it seems
We're not buying your dubious state of serenity
Acting all surprised when you're caught in the lie

We know better
It's not unlike you, it's not unlike you
We know your nature

Calm before the torrent comes
Calm before the torrent comes
Calm before the torrent comes
Calm before the tempest comes to reign all over

Disputing intentions invites devastation
A tempest must be true to its nature
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that

Control, your delusion
Insane and striking at random
Victim of your certainty, and therefore your doubt's not an option
Blameless, the tempest will be just that
So try as you may, feeble, your attempt to atone
Your words to erase all the damage cannot

A tempest must be just that

"Vicarious"

Eye on the TV
'Cause tragedy thrills me.
Whatever flavour
It happens to be like:
"Killed by the husband",
"Drowned by the ocean",
"Shot by his own son",
"She used a poison in his tea",
"And kissed him goodbye".
That's my kind of story.
It's no fun 'til someone dies.

Don't look at me like
I am a monster.
Frown out your one face
But with the other.
Stare like a junkie
Into the TV.
Stare like a zombie
While the mother
Holds her child,
Watches him die
Hands to the sky,
Crying, "Why, oh, why?"

'Cause I need to watch things die from a distance.
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies.

You all need it too.
Don't lie.

Why can't we just admit it?
Why can't we just admit it?

We won't give pause until the blood is flowing.
Neither the brave nor bold
Will write us the story, so,
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing.

I need to watch things die from a good safe distance.
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies.

You all feel the same.
So, why can't we just admit it?

Blood like rain come down.
Drum on grave and ground.

Part vampire, part warrior.
Carnivore and voyeur.
Stare at the transmittal.
Sing to the death rattle.

La, la, la, la, la, la, la-lie. [4x]

Credulous at best, your desire to believe in angels in the hearts of men.
Pull your head on out your hippie haze and give a listen.
Shouldn't have to say it all again.

The universe is hostile, so impersonal.
Devour to survive.
So it is. So it's always been.

We all feed on tragedy.
It's like blood to a vampire.

Vicariously I live while the whole world dies.
Much better you than I.

"Jambi"

Here from the king's mountain view
Here from a wild dream come true
Feast like a sultan I do
On treasures and flesh, never few

But I, I would wish it all away
If I thought I'd lose you just one day

The devil and his had me down
In love with the dark side I'd found
Dabblin' all the way down
Up to my neck soon to drown

But you changed that all for me
Lifted me up, turned me round
So I...
I...
I...
I...
I would
I would
I would
Wish this all away

Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn
Begged like a hooker all night long
Tempted the devil with my song
And got what I wanted all along

But I
And I would
If I could
And I would
Wish it away
Wish it away
Wish it all away
Wanna wish it all away
No prize that could hold sway
Or justify my giving away
My center

So if I could I'd wish it all away
If I thought tomorrow would take you away
You're my peace of mind, my home, my center
I'm just trying to hold on
One more day

Damn my eyes...
Damn my eyes...

Damn my eyes
If they should compromise
Our fulcrum
Wants and needs divide me then I might as well be gone

Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun

Shine on upon the broken
Shine until the two become one

Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun

Shine on upon the severed
Shine until the two become one

Divided I'm withering away

Divided I'm withering away

Shine on upon the many, light our way
Benevolent sun

Breathe in union
Breathe in union
Breathe in union
Breathe in union
Breathe in union
So as one survive
Another day and season

Silence, legion, save your poison
Silence, legion, stay out of my way

"Wings For Marie (Pt. 1)"

You believed.
You believed in movements none could see
You believed in me.

A passionate spirit.
Uncompromised
Boundless and open.
A light in your eyes, then, immobilized.

Vacant, broken.
Fell at the hands of
Those movements that I wouldn't see.
'Cause it was you who prayed for me so
What have I done to be a son to an angel?
What have I done to be worthy?

Day light dims leaving cold fluorescence.
Difficult to see you in this light.
Please forgive this selfish question, but
What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight?

She never told a lie.
Well might've told a lie,
But never lived one.
Didn't have a life.
Didn't have a life.
But surely saved one.
Saved one.

See? I'm alright, now
It's time for us to let you go.

"10,000 Days (Wings Pt. 2)"

We listen to the tales and romanticize,
How we'd follow the path of the hero.

Boast about the day when the rivers overrun,
How we rise to the height of our halo.

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize,
Our way into the arms of the savior.

Feigning all the trials and the tribulations.
None of us have actually been there,
Not like you...

Ignorant siblings in the congregation.
Gather around spewing sympathy,
Spare me...

None of them can even hold a candle up to you.
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see.

But enough about the collective Judas.
Who could deny you were the one who illuminated
Your little piece of the divine?

And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me
I'm gonna let it shine
To guide you safely on your way.

Your way home...

Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down?
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?

High is the way,
But our eyes are upon the ground.
You are the light and the way.
They'll only read about.
I only pray heaven knows,
When to lift you out.

10,000 days in the fire is long enough.
You're going home...

You're the only one who can hold your head up high.
Shake your fist at the gates saying,
"I've come home now!
Fetch me the spirit, the son and the father.
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.

It's time now!
My time now!
Give me my
Give me my wings!"

Give me my [5x]

Give me my wings

You are the light, the way,
That they will only read about.

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance.
Burden of proof tossed upon the believers.
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence,
Judith Marie, unconditional one.

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence.
Difficult to see you in this light.
Please forgive this bold suggestion.
Should you see your maker's face tonight,
Look him in the eye.
Look him in the eye and tell him,
"I never lived a lie, never took a life,
But surely saved one.

Hallelujah
It's time for you to bring me home."

"The Pot"

Who are you to wave your finger?
You must have been out of your head
Eye hole deep in muddy waters
You practically raised the dead

Rob the grave to snow the cradle
Then burn the evidence down
Soapbox, house of cards and glass
So don't go tossin' your stones around

You must have been high
You must have been high
You must have been

Foot in mouth and head up ass
So what you talkin' 'bout?
Difficult to dance 'round this one
'Til you pull it out, boy!

You must have been so high
You must have been so high

Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference
Kangaroo done hung the jury with the innocent

Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must have been high, high
You must have been high, high

Who are you to wave your finger?
So full of it
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Fuckin' hypocrite

Liar, lawyer, mirror, show me what's the difference?
Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent

Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been!

So who are you to wave your finger?
Who are you to wave your fatty fingers at me?
You must have been out your mind!

Weepin' shades of indigo shed without a reason
Weepin' shades of indigo

Liar, lawyer, mirror for you, what's the difference?
Kangaroo be stoned. He's guilty as the government

Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye!
Now when you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been high, high, high, high

Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Your balls deep in muddy waters
Ganja, please, you must have been out your mind!

"Lost Keys"

[Here is the conversation that takes place between the Nurse and the Doctor, and eventually the Doctor and the Patient.]

Lost Keys
[voices fading in]

[Nurse:] Excuse me? Doctor? If you have a moment?

[Doctor:] A moment? What's the question?

[Nurse:] More of a situation, a gentleman in exam 3.

[Doctor:] What's the problem?

[Nurse:] That is the problem, we're not sure.

[Doctor:] You got the chart?

[Nurse:] Right here.

[Doctor:] Not much there, is there?

[Nurse:] No doctor, no obvious physical trauma. Vitals are stable.

[Doctor:] Name?

[Nurse:] No sir.

[Doctor:]
Did someone drop him off?
Maybe we could speak to them.
Let's get some background on this fellow.

[Nurse:]
No ID. Nothing
[*heavy breathing in background*]
And he won't speak to anybody.

[Doctor:]
Well, let's say "Hello".
Good morning, I'm Dr. Watson.
How are you today? How – are – you today?!
Look, son, you're in a safe place.
We wanna help in whatever way we can.
But you need to talk to us.
We can't help you otherwise.
What's happened? Tell me everything.

[*growling and heavy breathing grows louder*]

"Rosetta Stoned"

Alright then, picture this if you will:
10 to 2 AM, X, Yogi DMT, and a box of Krispy Kremes, in my "need to know" pose, just outside of Area 51.
Contemplating the whole "chosen people" thing with just a flaming stealth banana split the sky like one would hope but never really expect to see in a place like this.
Cutting right angle donuts on a dime and stopping right at my Birkenstocks, and me yelping...
Holy fucking shit!

Then the X-Files being, looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan with Isabella Rossellini lips and breath that reeked of vanilla Chig Champa,
Did a slow-mo Matrix descent out of the butt end of the banana vessel and hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw, and my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip and all I could think was: "I hope Uncle Martin here doesn't notice that I pissed my fuckin' pants."

So light in his way,
Like an apparition,
He had me crying out,
"Fuck me.
It's gotta be
Deadhead Chemistry.
The blotter got right on top of me.
Got me seein' E-motherfuckin'-T!"

And after calming me down with some orange slices and some fetal spooning, E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose.
He said, "You are the Chosen One, the One who will deliver the message. A message of hope for those who choose to hear it and a warning for those who do not."
Me. The Chosen One?
They chose me!
And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school.

You'd better...
You'd better...
You'd better...
You'd better listen

Then he looked right through me
With somniferous almond eyes.
Don't even know what that means
Must remember to write it down.
This is so real.
Like the time Dave floated away.
See my heart is pounding,
'Cause this shit never happens to me.

Can't breathe, right now!
It was so real.
Like I woke up in Wonderland.
All sort of terrifying.
I don't wanna be all alone when I tell this story.
And can anyone tell me why
You all sound like Peanuts parents
Will I ever be coming down?
This is so real.
Finally it's my lucky day.
See my heart is racing,
'Cause this shit never happens to me.

Can't breathe, right now!

You believe me, don't you?
Please believe what I just said, see the Dead ain't touring.
And this wasn't all in my head.
See they took me by the hand and invited me right in,
Then they showed me something.
I don't even know where to begin.

Strapped down my bed. Feet cold and eyes red.
I'm out my head. Am I alive, am I dead?
Can't remember what they said.
God damn. Shit the bed!

High... I I I I I... high... I I I I I
High
[Repeated]

Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position.
Such a heavy burden now to be the one.
Born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending
To write it down for all the world to see.
But I forgot my pen,
Shit the bed again,
Typical.

Strapped down my bed.
Feet cold and eyes red.
I'm out my head.
Am I alive, am I dead?
Sunkist and Sudafed,
Gyroscopes and infrared.
Won't help, brain dead.
Can't remember what they said.
God damn. Shit the bed!

I can't remember what they said to me.
Can't remember what they said to make me out to be a hero!
Can't remember what they said.

Bob help me.
Can't remember what they said.

Don't know.
Won't know.
[Repeated]

God damn. Shit the bed!

"Intension"

[These lyrics are played backwards:]
Work hard, stay in school, listen to your mother, your father is right/rising/right, son.
Jesus loves you.
Work hard, stay in school, listen to your mother, your father is right/rising/right, son.

Pure as we begin.
Pure as we come in.
Pure as we begin.
Ruled by will alone.

Pure as we begin.
Here we have a stone.
Gather, place and raise soon.
Shelter turns to home.

Pure as we begin.
Here we have a stone.
Throw to stay the stranger.
Swore to crush his bones.

Ruled by will alone.

Spark becomes a flame.
Flame becomes a fire.
Light the way or warm this.
Home we occupy.

Spark becomes a flame.
Flame becomes a fire.
Forge a blade to slay the stranger.
Take whatever we desire.
Moved by will alone.

Pure as we begin.

Pure as we begin.
Move by will alone.
Leave as we come in.
Pure as light return to one.

Move by will alone.
Move by will alone.

"Right In Two"

Angels on the sideline,
Puzzled and amused.
Why did Father give these humans free will?
Now they're all confused.

Don't these talking monkeys know that
Eden has enough to go around?
Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys,
Where there's one you're bound to divide it.
Right in two.

Angels on the sideline,
Baffled and confused.
Father blessed them all with reason.
And this is what they choose.
And this is what they choose...

Monkey killing monkey killing monkey
Over pieces of the ground.
Silly monkeys give them thumbs,
They forge a blade,
And where there's one
They're bound to divide it,
Right in two.
Right in two.

Monkey killing monkey killing monkey.
Over pieces of the ground.
Silly monkeys give them thumbs.
They make a club.
And beat their brother, down.
How they survive so misguided is a mystery.

Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability to lift an eye to heaven conscious of its fleeting time here.

Gotta divide it all right in two [4x]

Fight 'til they die over wind, over sky
They fight over life, over prayer, over air and light
Over love, over sun, over another
They fight though they die over words polarizing.

Angels on the sideline again.
Benched along with patience and reason.
Angels on the sideline again
Wondering when this tug of war will end.

Gotta divide it all right in two [3x]
Right in two!

Right in two.

"The Grudge"

Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity.
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.
Desperate to control all and everything.
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.

Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end.
Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.
Terrified of being wrong. Ultimatum prison cell.

Saturn ascends, choose one or ten. Hang on or be humbled again.
Humbled again.

Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end.
Saturn ascends, comes round again.
Saturn ascends, the one, the ten. Ignorant to the damage done.

Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity.
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.
Desperate to control all and everything.
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.

Wear the grudge like a crown. Desperate to control.
Unable to forgive. And sinking deeper.

Defining, confining, sinking deeper.
Controlling, defining, and we're sinking deeper.

Saturn comes back around to show you everything
Let's you choose what you will, will not see and then
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again
Spits you out like a child, light and innocent.

Saturn comes back around. Lifts you up like a child
Or drags you down like a stone to
Consume you till you choose to let this go.
Choose to let this go.

Give away the stone. Let the oceans take and
Transmutate this cold and fated anchor.
Give away the stone. Let the waters kiss and
Transmutate these leaden grudges into gold.
Let go.

"The Patient"

A groan of tedium escapes me,
Startling the fearful.
Is this a test? It has to be,
Otherwise I can't go on.
Draining patience, drain vitality.
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old.

But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith,
And I'm still right here.

But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith,
And I'm still right here.

Wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.
Be patient (wait it out).

If there were no rewards to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through,
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now.
Gonna wait it out.

If there were no desire to heal
The damaged and broken met along
This tedious path I've chosen here
I certainly would've walked away by now.

And I still may, I still may be patient, be patient, be patient.

I must keep reminding myself of this.
I must keep reminding myself of this.
I must keep reminding myself of this.
I must keep reminding myself of this.

And if there were no rewards to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now.
And I still may.
And I still may.
And I still may.

And I am gonna wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.

"Schism"

I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end crippling our communication

I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from the squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication

(Cold, cold, cold)
Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion between supposed lovers
Between supposed brothers

I know the pieces fit [8x]

"Parabol"

So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
This one, this form I hold now.
Embracing you, this reality here,
This one, this form I hold now, so
Wide eyed and hopeful.
Wide eyed and hopefully wild.

We barely remember what came before this precious moment,
Choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside...
This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in
This body makes me feel eternal. All this pain is an illusion.

Choosing to be here in...

Be my reminder here that I am not alone in...
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
All this pain is an illusion

Twirling round with this familiar parable
Spinning, weaving round each new experience
Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing
A chance to be alive and breathing

This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality
Embrace this moment, remember, we are eternal
All this pain is an illusion

Suck and suck
Suckin' up all you can
Suckin' up all you can suck
Workin' up under my patience like a little tick
Fat little parasite

Suck me dry
My friend, bruised and borrowed
You thieving bastards
You have turned my blood cold and bitter
Beat my compassion black and blue

Hope this is what you wanted
Hope this is what you had in mind
'Cause this is what you're getting
I hope you're choking. I hope you choke on this

Taken all I can, taken all I can, fuckin' take
Taken all you can, taken all you can fuckin' take
Got nothing left to give to you

Blood-suckin' parasitic little tick
Blood-suckin' parasitic little tick
Blood-suckin' parasitic little tick
Take what you want and then go

Hope this is what you wanted
Hope this is what you had in mind

Suck me dry suck
Suck me dry suck
Suck me dry suck
Suck me dry

"Lateralus"

Black then white are all I see
In my infancy.
Red and yellow then came to be,
Reaching out to me,
Lets me see.

As below, so above and beyond,
I imagine drawn beyond the lines of reason.
Push the envelope. Watch it bend.

Over-thinking, over-analyzing separates the body from the mind.
Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must
Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.

Black then white are all I see
In my infancy.
Red and yellow then came to be,
Reaching out to me.
Lets me see

There is so much more
And beckons me
To look through to these
Infinite possibilities.

As below, so above and beyond,
I imagine drawn outside the lines of reason.
Push the envelope. Watch it bend.

Over-thinking, over-analyzing separates the body from the mind.
Withering my intuition, leaving opportunities behind.

Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line.
Reaching out to embrace the random.
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come.

I embrace my desire to
I embrace my desire to feel the rhythm, to feel connected
Enough to step aside and weep like a widow
To feel inspired, to fathom the power,
To witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain,
To swing on the spiral, to swing on the spiral,

To swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human.

With my feet upon the ground
I lose myself between the sounds
And open wide to suck it in.
I feel it move across my skin.

I'm reaching up and reaching out.
I'm reaching for the random or whatever will bewilder me.
Whatever will bewilder me.

And following our will and wind
We may just go where no one's been.
We'll ride the spiral to the end
And may just go where no one's been.

Spiral out. Keep going. [4x]

"Reflection"

I have come curiously close to the end, though
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole,
Defeated, I concede and
Move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness
How pitiful
It's calling me (calling me)
It's calling me (calling me)
It's calling me (calling me)
It's calling me...

And in my darkest moment, feeble and weeping
The moon tells me a secret - a confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me

Its source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting

And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt
Don't wanna be down here soothing my narcissism away.
I must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out
Before I pine away
Before I pine away
Before I pine away (pine away)
Before I pine away...

So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical,
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable.
And let the light touch you
So that the words spill through
And let them pass right through
Bringing out our hope and reason...

Before we pine away (pine away)
Before we pine away (pine away)
Before we pine away (pine away)
Before we pine away.

"No Quarter"
(originally by Led Zeppelin)

Lock all the doors, kill the lights.
No one's coming home tonight.
The sun beats down and don't you know?
All our lives are growing cold, oh...
They bring news that must get through.
To build a dream for me and you, oh.

Locked in a place where no one goes.

They ask no quarter

"Maynard's Dick"

It's all an open center
Opens up and lets the wind lift him away
It doesn't have to feel water
It's just a place that feels right with him
Kinda like the way you're breathing
I kinda like the way you keep looking away
Would you like to glide on
Slide a mile six inches at a time on Maynard's dick

There's a shyness found in reason
Apprehensive influence swallow away
You seem to feel abysmal take it
then you're careful grace for sure
Kinda like the way you're breathing
Kinda like the way you keep looking away
Would you like to climb on
Climb on my six inches and go down on Maynard's dick

Took you out in the back of the toolshed
Put it right on top of your forehead
Took you out in the back of the toolshed
Now you know what you're fuckin with... Maynard's dick!

"Stinkfist"

Something has to change.
Un-deniable dilemma.
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear.

Constant over-stimulation numbs me
But I would not want you
Any other way.

Just not enough.
I need more.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
I said
I don't want it.
I just need it.
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.

Finger deep within the borderline.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
Relax, turn around and take my hand.

I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure.
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way.

Blend and balance
Pain and comfort
Deep within you
'Til you will not want me any other way.

But it's not enough.
I need more.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
I said
I don't want it.
I just need it.
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.

Knuckle deep inside the borderline.
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.
Relax. Slip away.

(Chupa minha pica pichu)
(Chupa minha pica pinto)

(Chupa minha pica pinto)

(Relax, relax, relax, relax)

There's something kinda sad about
The way that things have come to be.
Desensitized to everything.
What became of subtlety?

Now how can this mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?

I'll keep digging
'Til I feel something.

Elbow deep inside the borderline.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
Shoulder deep within the borderline.
Relax. Turn around and take my hand.

"Eulogy"

He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.

He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.

We're gonna miss him.
We're gonna miss him.

Yeah, so long.
We wish you well.
Told us how you weren't afraid to die.
Well, so long.
Don't cry, yeah,
Or feel too down.
Not all martyrs see divinity.
But at least you tried.

Standing above the crowd,
He had a voice that was strong and loud.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart.
We'll miss him.
We'll miss him.

We're gonna miss him.
We're gonna miss him.

Yeah, no way, yeah, to recall
What it was that you had said to me,
Like I care at all.

But it was so loud.
You sure could yell.
Took a stand on every little thing
And so loud.

You could be the one who saves me from my own existence
Warn while some child might chill, nine-one-two

I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone symbol on you. So he bashes his skull through the window while looking out to the sea. Like torment of my ego. And we're amused by this

Yeah, standing above the crowd,
He had a voice that was strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so eager to identify with
Someone above the ground,
Someone who seemed to feel the same,
Someone prepared to lead the way,
And someone who would die for me.

Will you? Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fucking lie.

Don't you step out of line.
Don't you step out of line.
Don't you step out of line.
Don't you fucking lie.

You claimed all this time that you would die for me.
Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?

He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.
He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.

Come down.
Get off your fucking cross.
We need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr.

To ascend you must die.
You must be crucified
For our sins and our lies.
Goodbye...

"H."

What's coming through is alive.
What's holding up is a mirror.
But what's singing songs is a snake it is
Looking to turn my piss to wine.

They're both totally void of hate,
And killing me just the same.

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been.
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again.

And I feel this coming over like a storm again.
Considerately.

Venomous voice, tempts me,
Drains me, bleeds me,
Leaves me cracked and empty.
Drags me down like some sweet gravity.

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been.
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again.

And I feel this coming over like a storm again now [2x]

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,
Considerately killing me. [4x]

Without the skin here
Beneath the storm,
Under these tears now
The walls came down.

As the snake is drowned
As I look in his eyes,
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times.

I could have cried then.
I should have cried then.

And as the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
And will die.
It's all right.
I don't mind. [3x]

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,

And considerately killing me. [3x]

"Forty-Six & 2"

Join in my, join in my child,
And listen, I've been digging through my old numb shadow...

My shadow's
Shedding skin
I've been picking
Scabs again.
I'm down
Digging through
My old muscles
Looking for a clue.

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been.
I've been wallowing in my own confused and insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in.
I wanna feel the changes coming down.
I wanna know what I've been hiding in
My shadow.
My shadow.

Change is coming through my shadow.
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again.

Join in my
Join in my child
My shadow moves
Closer to meaning

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been.
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic, insecure delusions.

I wanna feel the change consume me,
Feel the outside turning in.
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured in
My shadow
My shadow

Change is coming.
Now is my time.
Listen to my muscle memory.
Contemplate what I've been clinging to.
Forty-six & 2 ahead of me.

I choose to live and to grow,
Take and give and to move,
Learn and love and to cry,
Kill and die and to be paranoid and to lie,
Hate and fear and to do
What it takes to move through.

I choose to live and to lie,
Kill and give and to die,
Learn and love and to do
What it takes to step through.

See my shadow changing,
Stretching up and over me.
Soften this old armor.
Hoping I can clear the way
By stepping through my shadow,
Coming out the other side.
Step into the shadow.
Forty-six & 2 are just ahead of me.

Figlio di puttana, sai che tu sei un pezzo di merda?
You think you're cool, right?
When you kicked out people out of the house
I tell you this, one of three Americans is dying out of cancer, you know?
Asshole, and you're gonna be one of those
I didn't have the courage to kick your ass directly
Don't have enough courage for that, I could, you know?
You know you're gonna have another accident?
You know I'm involved with black magic?
Fuck you, die, bastard
You think you're so cool? Asshole
And if I ever see your fucking face around in Europe or Italy
Well I'll, that time I'm gonna kick your ass
Fuck you, fucking Americans, Yankee
You're gonna die outta cancer, I promise
Deep pain, no one did what you did to me
You wanna know something? Fuck you
I want your balls smashed, eat shit, bastard
Pezzo di merda, figlio di puttana
Hope somebody in your family dies soon

"Hooker With A Penis"

I met a boy wearing Van, 501,
And a dope Beastie T,
Nipple rings
New tattoos that claimed that he
Was OGT,
Back from '92,
From the first EP.

And in between sips of Coke
He told me that he thought
We were sellin' out,
Layin' down,
Suckin' up to the man.

Well now I've got some advice for you, little buddy.
Before you point the finger you should know that I'm the man,
And if I'm the man, then you're the man, and he's the man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass.

All you know about me is what I've sold you, dumb fuck.
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name.
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit, then you bought one.

So I've got some advice for you, little buddy.
Before you point your finger you should know that I'm the man,
If I'm the fuckin' man then you're the fuckin' man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass.

All you know about me is what I've sold you, dumb fuck.
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name.
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit, then you bought one.

All you read and wear or see and hear on TV is a product waiting for your fatass dirty dollar

So, shut up and buy, buy, buy my new record
Buy, buy, buy,
Send more money
Fuck you, buddy.
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy.

"Jimmy"

What was it like to see,
The face of your own stability,
Suddenly look away,
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?

Eleven and she was gone.
Eleven is when we waved good-bye.
Eleven is standing still,
Waiting for me to free him,
By coming home.

Moving me with a sound.
Opening me within a gesture.
Drawing me down and in,
Showing me where it all began,
Eleven.

He was too scarred to realize,
You were the voice that's been calling me back home.

Under a dead Ohio sky,
Eleven has been and will be waiting,
Defending his light and wondering,
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping lost and numb
I'm so glad that I have found you.
I am wide awake and heading,
Home.

I wish that I could see you,
Turn and run to play.
Dreams are fading,
Carry my ancient soul.

Carry me into the light.
Aim your body heavenly,
Enduring a memory.
I'll come to your light,
Hold your light.
Hold your light where I can see it,

Hold it,
High.

Hold your light,
Eleven, lead me through each gentle step,
By step,
By inch by loaded memory,
I'll move,
To heal,
As soon as pain allows so we can,
Reunite,
And both move on together.

Hold,
Your light,
Eleven lead me through each gentle step,
By step,
By inch by loaded memory 'til
One
And one are one,
Eleven.
So glow,
Child,
Glow.
I'm heading back home...

I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Take care not to make me enter
If I do, we both may disappear

Know that I will choke until I swallow
Choke this infant here before me
What is this but my reflection?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?

But you're
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me

You still love me, you still love me
But you didn't need to push it on me
You still love me, you still love me
But you didn't need to push it on me

Rest your trigger on my finger
Bang my head upon the fault line
You better take care not to make me enter
'Cause if I do, we both may disappear

You still love me, you still love me

I'm slipping back into the gap again
I'm alive when you're touching me
Alive when you're shoving me down, yeah
But I'd trade it all
For just a little peace of mind

Push it on me, push it on me
Push it on me, push it on me
You're pushing, and shoving, and scrambling
To keep my feet flat on the ground

I am somewhere I don't wanna be, yeah
Push me somewhere I don't wanna be
You put me somewhere I don't wanna be
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see
Never want to see that place again

Saw that gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you, as well, my dear

If when I say I might fade like a sigh if I stay
You minimize my movement anyway
I must persuade you another way

Pushing and shoving
Pushing and shoving
Pushing me
There's no love in fear

Yeah, I'm staring down the hole again
Hands around my back again
Survival is my only friend
Terrified of what may come, yeah

Remember I'll always love you
As I claw your fucking throat away
It will end no other way

Some say the end is near.
Some say we'll see Armageddon soon.

The only way to fix it is to flush it all away.

Don't just call me pessimist.

And I can't imagine why you wouldn't welcome any change, my friend.

Bring it down
Suck it down.

"Third Eye"

[Spoken by Bill Hicks:]
See, I think drugs have done some good things for us, I really do. And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, do me a favour: go home tonight, take all your albums, all your tapes and all your CDs, and burn 'em. 'Cause you know what, the musicians who made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years... real fucking high on drugs.

Today young men on acid realise that all matter is purely energy condensed into a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death. Life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.

It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom is what it is, OK. Keep that in mind at all times. Thank you.

Dreaming of that face again.
It's bright and blue and shimmering.
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes.

On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye.

In... out... in... out... in... out...

A child's rhyme stuck in my head.
It said that life is but a dream.
I've spent so many years in question
to find I've known this all along.

"So good to see you.
I've missed you so much.
So glad it's over.
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play.
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play.
Why are you running?"

Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me.
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun.
I stick my hand into the shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand.
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been.
I do not recognize the vessel,
But the eyes seem so familiar.
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song...

"So good to see you.
I've missed you so much.
So glad it's over.
I've missed you so much.
Came out to watch you play.
Why are you running away?"

Prying open my third eye.
Prying open my third eye.
Prying open my third eye.
Prying open my third eye.

So good to see you once again.
I thought that you were hiding.
And you thought that I had run away.
Chasing the tail of dogma.

I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were.

I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were.

So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me.
you thought that I had run away.
Chasing a trail of smoke and the reason.

Prying open my third eye.

"Intolerance"

I don't wanna be hostile
I don't wanna be dismal
And I don't wanna rot in an apathetic existence
See I wanna believe you
And I wanted to trust you
And I wanna have faith to put away the dagger

But you lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
And I tolerate you
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
How can I tolerate?

Veil of virtue hung to hide your method
While I smile and laugh and dance and
Sing your praise and glory
Shroud of virtue hung to mask your stigma
As I smile and laugh and dance and
Sing your glory while

You lie, cheat and steal
Lie, cheat and steal
Lie, cheat and steal
I cannot tolerate you
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
I cannot tolerate

Our guilt, our blame, I've been far too sympathetic
Our blood, our fault, I've been far too sympathetic

I'm not innocent
I'm not innocent
You are not innocent
No one is innocent

Lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal

You lie, cheat and steal
Lie, cheat and steal
Lie, cheat and steal

I cannot tolerate you

I will not tolerate you
I will go down beside you
I must go down beside you
No one is innocent

"Prison Sex"

It took so long to remember just what happened
I was so young and vestal then you know it hurt me
But I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise

I've got my hands bound
And my head down,
And my eyes closed
My throat's wide open

I do unto others what has been done to me
Do unto others what has been done to you

I'm treading water
I need to sleep a while
My lamb and martyr,
You look so precious

Won't you—won't you come on a bit closer
Close enough so I can smell you

I need you to feel this
I can't stand to burn too long
Released in sodomy
For one sweet moment I am whole

I do unto you now what has been done to me
Do unto you now what has been done

You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise

Won't you—won't you come on a bit closer
Close enough so I can smell you

I need you to feel this
I need this to make me whole
Released in sodomy
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted
And only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind

Got your hands bound,
And your head down
And your eyes closed
You look so precious now

I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
Shit blood and cum on my hands
I've come round full circle

My lamb and martyr,
This will be over soon

You look so precious [6x]

"Sober"

There's a shadow just behind me,
Shrouding every step I take,
Making every promise empty,
Pointing every finger at me.
Waiting like a stalking butler
Who upon the finger rests.
Murder now the path of "must we"
Just because the son has come.

Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past is done?
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past is done?

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over.
Why can't we drink forever?
I just want to start this over.

I am just a worthless liar.
I am just an imbecile.
I will only complicate you.
Trust in me and fall as well.
I will find a center in you.
I will chew it up and leave,
I will work to elevate you
Just enough to bring you down.

Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past is done?
Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past is done?

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over.
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over.

I am just a worthless liar.
I am just an imbecile.
I will only complicate you.
Trust in me and fall as well.
I will find a center in you.
I will chew it up and leave,
Trust me [5x]

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start things over.
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over.

I want what I want [4x]

"Bottom"
(feat. Henry Rollins)

Compassion is broken now
My will is eroded now
Desire is broken now
It makes me feel ugly
I'm on my knees and burning
My piss and moans are the fuel
That set my head on fire
So smell my soul is burning
I'm broken, looking up to see the enemy
I have swallowed the poison you feed me
But I survive on the poison you feed me, and it leaves me
Guilt-fed, hatred-fed, weakness-fed
It makes me feel ugly
I’m on my knees and burnin'
My piss and moans are the fuel
That set my head on fire
Dead inside
Shit adds up, shit adds up
Shit adds up at the bottom

[Henry Rollins:]
If I let you, you would make me destroy myself
In order to survive you, I must first survive myself
And I can sink no further and I cannot forgive you
There’s no choice but to confront you
To engage you
To erase you
I’ve gone to great lengths to expand my threshold of pain
I will use my mistakes against you
There’s no other choice
Shameless now, nameless now, nothing now, no one now
And my soul must be iron
Cause my fear is naked
I’m naked and fearless
And my fear is naked

Dead inside, dead inside
Dead inside, dead inside
Nameless now, shameless now
Nothing now, no one now

Shit adds up, shit adds up
Shit adds up, as you see me
Naked now, fearless now
Naked now, fearless now

Shit adds... shit adds...
Shit adds... shit adds up it leaves me
Dead inside, dead inside
Dead inside, dead inside

Hatred keeps me alive
Hungriness keeps me alive
Weakness keeps me alive
Guilt keeps me alive at the bottom

Crawled away from me.
Slipped away from me.
Tried to keep a hold,
But there was nothing I could say.

Slid away from me.
Crept away from me.
Tried to keep you down,
But there was nothing I could say.

What you trying to say?
That you don't wanna play?
What you want and what you need,
don't mean that much to me.

I can see your back is turning.
If I could I'd stick a knife in.

My warning meant nothing
You're dancing in quicksand
Why don't you watch where you're wandering?
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling?
You're wading knee deep and going in

"Undertow"

Two times in.

I've been struck dumb by a voice that
speaks, from deep beneath peerless water that's,
twice as clear as heaven,
twice as loud as reason.
Deep and rich like silt on a riverbed,
just as neverending.
Current's mouth below me;
opens up around me.
suggests and beckons all while swallowing.
Surrounds and drowns, and wipes me away.

But I'm so comfortable... So comfortable.

Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up,
you're saturating me.
How could I let this bring me,
back to my knees?

Third time in.

I've been baptized by your voice that,
screams, from deep beneath the cold black water that's,
half as high as heaven,
half as clear as reason.
cold and black like silt on the riverbed.
Just as neverending.
Current's mouth below me;
opens up around me.
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing.
Surrounds and drowns, and wipes me away.

But I'm so comfortable... So comfortable.

Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up,
you're saturating me.
How could I let this happen?

Why don't you kill me?
I am weak and numb and insignificant,
How could I let this bring me back to my knees?

Eu...phor...ia. [x4]

I'm back down, I'm in the undertow.
I'm helpless and I'm awake, I'm in the undertow.
I'll die beneath the undertow.
There doesn't seem to be a way out of the undertow.

Eu..phor..ia.

"4° (4 Degrees)"

Get up, get up now [4x]

Free yourself from yourself [2x]

Locked up inside you
Like the calm beneath castles
A cavern of treasures that
No one has been to
Let's go digging
Let's go digging
Bring it out and take it back in

You won't do what you'd like to do
Lay back and let me show you another way

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away

Take it all
Take it all in

All the way in
All the way in
Let it go
Let it go in

You won't feel what you'd like to feel
Lay back and let me show you another way

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away

Knock me down
I'll just come back running
Knock you down
It won't be long now
All the way in
All the way in
All the way
All the way
Way in!

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away

Take it up, take it up higher
4 degrees now, 4 degrees warmer
Give in now
Give in now

Let me in!

You'll like this in
This brings us out
You'll like this
It brings us closer than
Dying and cancer and crying
Let's take it, take it...

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it

Just like that
Just like that
Just like...

"Flood"

Here comes the water

All I knew and all I believed
Are crumbling images
That no longer comfort me
I scramble to reach higher ground
Some order and sanity
Or something to comfort me

So I take what is mine,and hold what is mine
Suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine
Soon the water will come
And claim what is mine
I must leave it behind
And climb to a new place now

This ground is not the rock I thought it to be

Thought I was high
Thought I was free
I thought I was there
Divine destiny

I was wrong
This changes everything

The water is rising up on me
Thought the sun would come deliver me
But the truth has come to punish me instead

The ground is breaking down right under me
Cleanse and purge me
In the water

"Disgustipated"

And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber.
And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself.
And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own Midwest.
And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil.
One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear. And terror possessed me then

And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?"

And the angel said unto me, "These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots!
You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust."

And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared,
"Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you!
Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!"

Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus

It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky then.
That made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too.
When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes. Your hands were sticky.
You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green.
Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this?

You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up.
Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this.
You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you.
You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it.
"If God is our Father," you thought, "then Satan must be our cousin."
Why didn't anyone else understand these important things?

You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked.
It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat.
Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them.
Now red was your color and, of course, those little people out there were yours too

"Sweat"

I'm sweating,
and breathing
and staring and thinking
and sinking
deeper.
It's almost like I'm swimming.

The sun is burning hot again
on the hunter
and the fisherman,
and I’m trying to remember when,
but it makes me dizzy.

Seems like I've been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I'm slipping
into a dream within a dream.

Must be the way you whisper.

Used to be a bunch of assholes that lived in this part of the building here, but we systematically removed them like you would any kind of termite or roach

Someone told me once
That there's a right and wrong
Punishment was cure for those
Who dare to cross the line

But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you
And maybe it takes longer to catch a total asshole
I'm tired of waiting

Now he thinks he's a fire engine
It's okay until he pisses on your lighter
Kinda smells kinda cool kinda funny anyway

satan, satan, satan...

I had a friend once he took some ecstasy
Tried to marry me and every one in the room
He was sort of loving kinda caring,
kinda tried to fuck my lazy boy
It got a bit messy all over the curtains,
arm chair covers, throw pillows, and carpeting

satan, satan, satan...

I'm getting bored again...
